N2  - Like any other disease, accidents too are caused by interaction between agent, host, and environment. Human factors include age, (accidents most common between 10 and 24 years), sex, education, medical conditions (heart attack, impaired vision), fatigue, influence of alcohol and other drugs, lack of bodily protection (like helmets, seat belts) and psychosocial factors like lack of experience, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, defective judgment and delay in decisions. Drunken driving is an important risk factor in causing accidents. This study was focused on the status of alcohol consumption in relation with roadside accidents in northern India in the region of Amritsar. The present study was carried out in 100 cases alleged to have died of roadside accident and brought to the mortuary attached to the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Government Medical College, Amritsar for autopsy examination. Blood samples were collected from the femoral vein and were tested for the presence of alcohol with steam distillation and titration method using potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid. In the present study, 23% of the fatal driver/pedestrian victims of roadside accidents were found to have consumed alcohol before accident. Most of the victims of road accident were from the age group 21-30 and 31-40 years. Most of the accidents occurred on straight roads instead of bends or intersections, more during daytime and weekends. 57% of the blood alcohol positives were between 100 mg% and 149 mg%. Majority of the victims of roadside accidents were motorcyclists and the striking vehicles were trucks and buses causing head & neck injuries in most of the victims. Death occurred within a few minutes in most of the cases.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incidence of maxillofacial trauma is increasing at a very fast pace in developing countries like India and poses a major health burden. Hence, the epidemiological data of maxillofacial trauma during a 6 year period, was analyzed to study the characteristics, factors predisposing, and aid in advocating strict guidelines to prevent the same. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data related to 638 cases with maxillofacial trauma, from January 2008 to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively and the data regarding gender, age, etiology, anatomic location of fracture, alcohol consumption, associated head and other injuries, modality of treatment rendered and associated complications were analyzed with descriptive statistics. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 638 patients presenting with 869 maxillofacial fractures were analyzed. Most of them [344 (53.9%)] were young adults aged 18-40, whereas, 123 (19.2%) were 11 to 17 years, and 97(15.2%) adults. Men (79.4%) were more affected than women. Road traffic accidents remain the main etiology causing fractures in 470 (73.6%), whereas 397 (62.2%) had history of consumption of alcohol. Those with alcohol intoxication had multiple injuries. Mandible was more frequently involved with 360 (41.4%) fractures, and condyle being the most common site. A total of 374 (58.6%) underwent open reduction with internal fixation under general anesthesia. Prevalence of other injuries was noted in 207 (32.4%) and complications of fracture treatment in 41(6.4%) cases. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Road traffic accidents under alcohol influence were most commonly associated with comminuted facial fractures with head injuries, frequently leading to death. Mandible was the most commonly fractured facial bone followed by zygoma.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: The health and economic consequences of alcohol consumption have been assessed mainly in developed countries. This study aims to estimate health impact and economic burden attributable to alcohol use in India. <br><br>METHODS: A combination of decision tree and mathematical markov model was parameterized to assess the health effects and economic cost attributable to alcohol consumption. Health effect of alcohol was modelled for a time period of 2011 to 2050 on three sets of conditions - liver disease, cancers and road traffic accidents. Estimates of illness, death, life years lost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated as a result of alcohol consumption. Both direct and indirect costs were estimated to determine economic burden. Future costs and consequences were discounted at 3% for time preferences of cost and utility. Uncertainties in parameters were assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. <br><br>RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2050, alcohol attributable deaths would lead to a loss of 258 million life years. In contrast, 552 million QALYs would be gained by eliminating alcohol consumption. Treatment of these conditions will impose an economic burden of INR 3127 billion (US$ 48.11 billion) on the health system. Societal burden of alcohol, inclusive of health system cost, out of pocket expenditure and productivity losses will be INR 121,364 billion (US$ 1867 billion). Even after adjusting for tax receipts from sale of alcohol, alcohol poses a net economic loss of INR 97,895 billion (US$ 1506 billion). This amounts to an average loss of 1.45% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per year to the Indian economy. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Alcohol causes significant negative health impact and economic burden on Indian society and evidence informed policy interventions are needed to control alcohol attributable harm.<br><br>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Heavy alcohol drinking and propensity to risk taking behaviour may both be associated with the occurrence of high risk behaviour. The present study was carried out to examine the association between high risk behaviours and alcohol abuse among patients admitted to an inpatient facility for treatment of alcohol dependence syndrome. METHODS: Using event analysis technique, the prevalence and type of high risk behaviour as a consequence of a heavy drinking episode was identified among heavy drinkers. Four types of high risk behaviour namely road traffic accidents, violence, self-injurious and risky sexual behaviour were studied. Patients with and without high risk behaviour were compared on measures of severity of drinking, sensation seeking and impulsivity using addiction severity index, sensation seeking scale and Baratt's impulsivity scale respectively. RESULTS: In 300 subjects with alcohol dependence syndrome, the most common high risk behaviour was road traffic accident following alcohol use. In 193 (64.3%) subjects heavy drinking episode was associated with high risk behaviours. Compared to those without high risk behaviours, the subjects with high risk behaviours had higher scores on sensation seeking scale and addiction severity index. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that there was a high prevalence of high risk behaviour following an episode of heavy drinking in male patients with alcohol dependence syndrome. Both, severity of drinking and personality factors were associated with the occurrence of high risk behaviour as a consequence of heavy drinking.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - CONTEXT: Severity of alcohol dependence is related to the high-risk behavior of alcohol dependents. <br><br>AIM: To assess the high-risk behavior in patients with alcohol dependence and study the association between them. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a descriptive study of high-risk behavior in patients with alcohol dependence, conducted over a period of 15-month duration that is from January 2011 to April 2012 on 200 alcohol-dependent patients (178 men and 22 women) in the Department of Psychiatry, Mamata Medical College and General Hospital, Khammam (TS), India. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients and their caregivers fulfilling the selection criteria were included in the study, and informed consent was obtained. Interview was carried out after 2 weeks to rule out the possibility of the presence of withdrawal symptoms in alcohol-dependent patients. Tools used for data collection include Sociodemographic and Clinical Profile Schedule, Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Mini-Mental Status Examination, Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire, and High Risk Behavior Questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and logistic regression test were used. <br><br>RESULTS: The occurrence of high-risk behavior was substantial among patients with alcohol dependence syndrome. Event analysis method indicated that road traffic accidents associated with prior heavy drinking was the most frequently observed high-risk behavior. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The study reiterates the relationship between alcohol and sexual behavior and also highlights that individuals dependent on alcohol are a specifically vulnerable group.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is an alarming trend of injuries leading to poor outcome of victims in India. OBJECTIVE: To study the profile of patients who died due to trauma and to identify factors involved in both pre-hospital and hospital care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based study was performed at a trauma center in Puducherry from June 2009 to May 2010. Patients who had at least one sign of life on admission and later died were included. The demographic characteristics, injury mechanism, nature and site of injury, influence of alcohol, pre-hospital time and care, distance traveled, number of referrals, time spent in study hospital, cause of death, and missed injuries revealed at post mortem were noted. RESULTS: Of the 204 fatal cases, most were between 25-65 years of age (77%); sustained injuries over weekends (36%) and between 4 pm and midnight (41%); had at least one halt in a medical facility before reaching definitive care (56%); and died within a week (63%). Adults (25-65 y) sustained most injuries (77%) on two wheelers. In those aged over 65 years, 79 percent were pedestrians. Road traffic injuries were responsible for 82 % of deaths; 16 percent were reportedly under the influence of alcohol at the time of injury. Mean delay from the time of accident to admission was 14.9 hours and median distance traveled was 30 kilometers. Head injury was the most common (66%) cause of death. Post mortem revealed skull fractures (37%), while missed injuries were noted in 8 percent, mostly involving the cervical spine and chest wall. CONCLUSION: The problem of trauma care needs to be addressed urgently in this part of southern India to reduce mortality and morbidity.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

TI  - Making the road safety SDG targets count: delivering quick wins for road traffic injury prevention (Safety-2016 abstract #8)

N2  - Since January 2016 the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),1 or 'Global Goals' have been in force. The decision by negotiators from 190 countries, endorsed by world leaders, to include in these Goals an ambitious and accelerated road safety target to halve road deaths by 2020 demonstrates a recognition of the scale of this appalling human epidemic and the need for urgent action to reduce the preventable toll of death and injury caused by road traffic crashes.    With less than five years remaining to achieve the target, quick and early results are essential. Governments established the deadline, and governments must lead in reaching the objective. The top ten countries by population (China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, USA, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Russia) together account for an estimated 725,794 road fatalities. Achieving the SDG target of a 50% reduction in road traffic deaths in these countries would contribute more than half (362,897) the necessary 600,000 reduction in annual deaths.2 So, as an essential step, governments in these ten countries need to commit, at the highest level, to tackling an epidemic which is killing their citizens on an industrial scale.    Some governments must also urgently recognise the true scale of their road traffic fatality problem which current injury data collection methods are not capturing. This is important for building public and political support for action, and for effectively identifying and targeting risk factors. For example, China estimates deaths of 58,539, which equates to a rate per 100,000 of just over 4. The WHO estimate is 261,367, or 18.8 per 100,000; India estimates 137,572, 70,000 fewer than the WHO estimate; Nigeria officially estimates road traffic deaths of 6,450. The WHO point estimate is 35,641.3 Understanding and accepting the scale of the problem is a vital first step to dealing with it.The means of implementation and financing will also be key to effective delivery, and moving from words on a communique to measurable action on the ground. For the road safety sector there are three key challenges.The first is to secure sufficient international catalytic financing to assist governments of middle- and low-income countries to take the initial steps - building the institutional capacity, political will and evidence base - necessary to unlock sustainable sources of domestic funding to deliver long-term road safety strategies. To encourage donors to invest strategically, the global road safety community should be offering a united front, and an obvious place to convene. There is currently discussion, led by the UN-ECE, and given support by the UN General Assembly,4 on developing a new UN global fund that can provide a secure destination for new funds with high standards of governance and accountability; a strong strategic direction for catalytic capacity building efforts; and the credibility to succeed as a broad-based multi-donor platform.But building new architecture takes time, and time is short. Donors, whether governments, philanthropies or the private sector don't need to wait for a new UN Fund to start funding. The significant funding and efforts of Bloomberg Philanthropies;5 the work of the Global Road Safety Facility, which has achieved a significant leverage effect with core resources of less than $3 million per year; and the innovating effect of funding from the FIA Foundation for initiatives like the Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP)6 and the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP):7 these show what can be achieved.The second key challenge is to persuade finance ministers and private investors of the strong case for investment in safe and sustainable transport modes; that this isn't an optional extra, but should be mainstreamed into every transportation and land-planning decision. We need to show national transport, health and finance ministries that it is worth investing a bit more today in order to reap rewards in health cost savings tomorrow. This requires a change in the way cost-benefit for transport schemes is calculated; it requires a breaking down of the silos that separate transport investment from health outcomes; it requires an injection of the human dimension into the debate.Working towards this objective of realising the true value of road safety investment was the purpose of the FIA Foundation's 2015 report 'Breaking the Deadlock: A social impact investment lens on reducing costs of road trauma and unlocking capital for road safety',8 commissioned from Social Finance and Impact Strategist. Social Impact Bonds and other 'innovative financing' mechanisms may play a role in releasing new sources of primarily private sector funding (and development bonds could also be an effective way to deliver health objectives in low-income countries in the area of road safety).But the Social Finance/Impact Strategist report also suggests that the discipline of designing a project that meets the exacting expectations of a private investor, structured in a way that makes transparent the different types of social beneficiary so that metrics - on which repayment schedules would be predicated - are clearly defined, would identify the health and social benefits of a road safety scheme in a way to transparently demonstrate value for money. A new stage of the work, with research and data analysis being undertaken in Australia and Cambodia, suggests the argument will be compelling.    The third challenge is to connect road traffic injury prevention with wider health and environmental agendas and financing mechanisms intended to support delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals and the climate change agenda, for example through the new 'Sustainable Mobility for All' initiative proposed by World Bank President Jim Kim at the 2016 Climate Action Summit. The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change is, as much as the Global Goals, a driver for international priority setting and transport has a big role to play. Demonstrating that poor road safety is a symptom of the wider transport system dysfunction that results in high levels of carbon emissions, and that there are common solutions that can fix both, and other, issues is critically important.    For the FIA Foundation, a key priority is to develop a holistic approach in the area of child health. In June 2016 we launched a new Global Initiative for Child Health & Mobility,9 together with UNICEF, UNEP, the World Resources Institute, Save the Children and the Overseas Development Institute. Our partnership is concerned with road safety, air pollution and low carbon mobility, and focusing on particular areas which impact on the way children use transportation and streets. This includes speed legislation and traffic enforcement; provision of safe infrastructure such as sidewalks and crossings; attention to the quality and affordable availability of school transport; and promoting safe and healthy journeys to school - whether travelling on foot, by bicycle, by bus or on a motorbike or in a car. There are strong arguments and synergies to be made with other constituencies - on air pollution, non-communicable diseases, liveable cities and promoting active mobility for health and a low carbon future. We should be seeking allies, breaking down barriers and working in concert wherever possible.    But while many of these structural changes and new alliances will take time, longer in some cases than the immediate four year time horizon we face, there are quick wins that can achieve results now. The World Health Organisation is leading efforts to promote a focused road safety package of interventions that countries can adopt, with an emphasis on tackling speed; improving road design; ensuring all cars at the very least meet UN safety standards; providing sidewalks for pedestrians and bike lanes for cyclists; raising motorcycle helmet and seat belt wearing; and enforcing drink driving laws.    If it is too difficult to persuade some governments to act without the more far-reaching philosophical, cultural or management changes described above, we should seek paths of least resistance, and get done what we can. Cities can be incubators of change, moving faster than the national ministries. Megacities like Sao Paolo and New York have reduced road traffic deaths by more than 20% in just a couple of years, by focusing on speed reduction and providing better access for pedestrians and cyclists.10     If many more cities can be encouraged to take this path, and see these results, we'll be closer to achieving the target. This year's Habitat III policy process provides a great platform for making this case.NGOs can also take a lead, through rigorous diagnosis and effective action. For example, Global NCAP is using independent consumer crash tests of cars to raise safety standards in Latin America, India and SE Asia with the objective that by 2020 all cars in production at least meet the minimum standards recommended by the UN. This could save thousands of lives. iRAP is working to persuade more countries to implement basic road design and management changes to maximise travel for all road users on four star roads or better. Through our Child Health Initiative the FIA Foundation is supporting partners in raising child motorcycle helmet wearing rates in Asia; making the case for providing sidewalks to school in Africa; and reducing vehicle speeds where pedestrians are walking, everywhere.    The SDG target to halve road deaths by 2020 will be very difficult to achieve. But smallpox and polio once seemed insurmountable, and are now all but vanquished. Child mortality for the under-fives has halved since 1990.11     Road traffic injuries are now part of the global health and development agenda - the Global Goals. By using this opportunity to better connect with other issues and sectors that have a common stake in improving mobility and health; by providing a clearer (and ideally forensic) analysis of the health and environmental consequences of inaction; by laying down a vocal challenge to governments to follow their words with action - and praising those that respond; and by showing the path to casualty reduction through evidence and examples of success: we can make the change and prevent many, many human tragedies.

Detailed history was obtained. Investigations including imaging was done as indicated. Predictors of eye injuries and prognostic factors for vision were assessed. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 135 eyes of 126 patients were evaluated. Males constituted 92.06%. Road traffic accident (RTA), domestic injuries, assault, and work-place-related injuries accounted for 86.5%, 4.7%, 2.3%, and 2.3%. Alcohol consumption (42.06%) and lack of eye protective device (94.4%) and injury to posterior segment were the major risk factors. On presentation 80.6% had visual acuity ≥ 6/12. Orbital and maxillofacial fractures were noted in 70.6% of cases. Closed-globe injury was seen in 83 (61.4%) and open-globe injury in 2 (1.4%). Majority (86.7%) suffered soft tissue injuries. Common sight-threatening injuries were traumatic optic neuropathy (4.4%), vitreous haemorrhage (0.7%), retrobulbar haemorrhage (0.7%), and commotio retinae (0.7%). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Most of the injuries in this population occurred from RTA, with associated fractures, adnexal and globe injuries. Alcohol consumption and lack of eye protective device were the major risk factors. Patients with open-globe injuries and injuries with posterior segment involvement had poor visual outcome.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Injuries now rank among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality the world over. Injuries are steadily increasing in developing countries like India. Systematic and scientific efforts in injury prevention and control are yet to begin in India. Data on injuries are very essential to plan preventive and control measures. The objective of this study is to know the profile of the injury cases admitted to M S Ramaiah hospital, Bangalore, India, using a cross-sectional study design for six months, i.e. from Oct 2008 to April 2009. The mean age of the study population was 35.3 years (SD = 15.38), 69.1% were injured in road traffic accidents (RTA), 28.7% due to falls and 2.2% due to burns. Nearly 14.4% were under the influence of alcohol. Nearly 73.6% of RTA cases were two-wheeler users, 48.5% had not followed sign boards and 56.5% had not obeyed the one-way rules, 63.5% of the two-wheeler users did not use helmets. Also, 38% of two wheelers had two pillion riders, whereas 57% of four-wheeler users had not used a seat belt. Among falls, 58% occurred at home, 49% occurred due to slippery surface. Road traffic accidents were the most common cause for injuries, in which two wheelers were most commonly involved. Strict enforcement of traffic rules and education on road safety are very essential to prevent injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE    Several studies have demonstrated that driving under influence of alcohol and psychoactive drugs increases the risk of fatal accidents & hence increased mortality rates. This paper presents a retrospective study of Road & Rail traffic accidents in Mangaluru.     Method    Over a six-year period (2010-2015), a total of 5226 autopsies were conducted at Govt. Wenlock Hospital, Mangaluru out of which 1261 were Vehicular accidents (1117-Road, 144-Rail). Various parameters were looked in these cases such as age groups, gender, type of Vehicle involved, Victim status, time of day, day of the week (weekdays/weekend), Season, type of intoxication, accident site etc.     Results    15.85% (n = 177) of all the Road Traffic Deaths & 9.72% (n=14) of all Rail deaths occurred as a consequence of either alcohol (16.83%, n=188/191) or drug overdose (n=3). 42.93% of victims belonged to 56 and above age group. Most commonly the e the vehicle which were involved in accident were motorcycles (around 51.83% cases).     Conclusions    The results of this study reveals a strong positive association between the presence of alcohol and psychoactive drugs in road & rail traffic accident victims. The matter of grave concern is increasing trend of drunken driving leading to fatal accidents among adolescent age-groups especially in motorcycle vehicles.

N2  - PURPOSE: To study the epidemiology and clinical profile of ocular trauma patients presenting to tertiary care centre.     Materials and Methods: Prospective study. All patients of ocular trauma in OPD/Emergency were assessed for detail between 1/1/17 to 31/6/18 and data on demographic profile was established as per guidelines of Ocular Trauma Society of India. Patients were categorized in different segments and assessed/followed for visual impairment in particular.     Results: A total of 246 cases were examined out of which 87% were males. The most common mode of ocular injury was Road Traffic Accidents. Pediatric eye trauma constituted 16.7% of the total cases. 26.8% cases arrived to our centre between 4-24 hours and 62.6% cases presented after 24 hours. Amongst 131 cases of Road Traffic Accidents, none of them were using protective measures like helmets or goggles. Of these, 17.1% were under the influence of alcohol. 28.5% were involved in medicolegal proceedings. Majority of the cases comprised of monocular trauma (78.1%). Closed globe injuries constituted 88.94% of the total cases of which most cases presented with lid edema and ecchymosis. Chemical injuries were reported in 4.5% cases. 9 patients lost vision completely and 71 cases had vision from light perception to 6/18.     Conclusions: Ocular trauma is one of the common causes of ocular morbidity. It has been seen predominantly in male population. Public needs to be educated about safety measurements and education about prompt need to specialised care to reduce ocular trauma related visual morbidity.        Keywords: Ocular injuries, Visual morbidity, Road traffic accidents, Close globe injuries, Chemical injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - World Health Organization defined accidents as '' an unexpected, unplanned occurrence which may involve injury''1.Only 28 countries, covering 7% of the world's population, have comprehensive road safety laws on all five key risk factors: drinking and driving, speeding, and failing to use helmets, seat-belts, and child restraints as per the global status report on Road Safety 2013 by World Health Organization1. India is undergoing major economic and demographic transition coupled with increasing urbanization and motorization. Injuries on roads, at homes, and in the workplace have increased due to lack of safety-related policies and programs. The health sector bears the maximum brunt in terms of provision of acute care, and short-term and long term rehabilitation service. This study describes profile of motorcyclists' victims in road traffic accidents observation done and they were compared with the previous studies.This study was conducted toanalyzethe sociodemographic profile of motorcycle crashes among total cases of RTA.During study period, a total number of 22618 patients were admitted to trauma centre, from which 10564 were road traffic accident cases, from which 25 % were two wheeler clashes.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: According to the WHO, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.24 million deaths worldwide in the year 2010, down from 1.26 million in 2000. In the South East Asian region of the WHO, India alone accounted for 73% of RTA burden. Aims & Objective: To assess knowledge and practice of road safety measures among undergraduate medical students.<br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Cross-sectional study was conducted among 310 Medical students in AGMC campus during month of September to October 2013. The participants were selected by convenient sampling technique and information collected using structured questionnaire. The percentage, χ2 test etc. had been employed in the analysis of data. <br><br>RESULTS: Majority (67.4%) of the participants were in the age group of 20 -25 years and males (53.2%). Majority knew that consumption of alcohol while driving was dangerous, talking while driving distract the driver, cautious drive near school, seat belt to be worn by everyone in the car, loud music in the car distract driver, should drive in the left lane, over taking in the right only, give way to ambulance, use of hand free devices was safe while driving, wait patiently when pedestrians were taking too much time in zebra crossing and correct knowledge of speed limit was essential. Males had significantly (p=0.035) better knowledge compared to females. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The overall knowledge and practice of road safety measures was high among the study participants. Continuous efforts should be on to increase road safety measures through IEC activities to reduce the morbidity and mortality regarding RTAs. Further research was recommended among various sub-groups of population.<p />

N2  - After the Metropolitan Traffic Police, Kathmandu initiated a "No Drinking and Driving" policy in 2011 in which a major intervention for intoxicated drivers was mandatory 1-hour class to modify drunk driving behaviors, reports show that the number of road traffic accidents in the year 2012 decreased by 23 percent from the year 2011. The injury to fatality ratio decreased by 21 percent in this period. We remain encouraged by these statistics which confirm that increased enforcement of road traffic rules, combined with behavioral change programs, can have positive changes in LMICs which suffer considerably from the global burden of trauma.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a complex phenomenon caused by nonlinear combination and interaction of man, vehicles, road, and environment. <br><br>AIM: This study aims to find out the outcome and severity of RTI in a district of West Bengal, India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted among inpatients of Departments of Surgery and Orthopedics of Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital, West Bengal, India. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted for 1 year interviewing 295 RTI selected through scheduled sampling. Information pertaining to demographic and correlates of RTI was collected by face to face and over telephone using semi-structured questionnaire. Nine-item Simplified Injury Severity Scale (SISS) was used to assess injury severity. Internal consistency of SISS scale was showed by Cronbach's alpha and association with the correlates was done by Mann-Whitney U-test. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: With SPSS version 22.0, binary logistic regression, and Mann-Whitney U-test. <br><br>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Fatal outcome in terms of death and permanent disability was 34.24% and they had higher marginally significant (<i>P</i> = 0.06), SISS score (45.17 ± 12.59). Participants with absence of protective devices, presence of comorbidities, drunkenness, with accidents over national highways, in-between 6 am and 6 pm, mechanized two-wheelers, and nonreceipt of first aid were found to have significantly high scores compared to their counterpart. SISS, as a proxy measure of severity assessment, could throw a light on it and awareness generation and legislative stringency might be need of the hour for the country.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Context: Road traffic accidents (RTA) are a foremost rising cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries like India. The Government of India enacted a new motor vehicle amendment act (MVA) on September 1st 2019 that permits heavy penalties for traffic rule offenders.     Aims: To find out the early impact of "THE MOTOR VEHICLES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2019".     Settings and Design: A retrospective observational study was performed during the time period July to October 2019 on RTA patients admitted to the Trauma and Emergency department.     Methods and Materials: Patients studied in two groups - One Pre MVA group (n = 371) and one Post MVA group (n = 415). The data were extracted from medical case records of the department and filled up in a structured format. Detailed demographic profile, including the use of safety measure and clinical variables such as the pattern of injury and injury severity scores, were recorded.   Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was done by R version 3.6.1.     Results: There is a 41% drop in RTA victims post MVA implementation. Polytrauma reduced (25% vs 45.5%) significantly (P = 0.002) and so was Injury severity score (6.00 vs 13.00). More RTA victims were wearing helmets as compared to previous (42% vs 18%), and there was a steep decline in the alcohol driving (25% vs 10%) between the pre and post MVA group. A significant reduction noted in the under 18 yrs. Two-wheeler riders in the post MVA group compared to earlier (P = 0.016).     Conclusions: The study reveals that there is a commendable reduction in the injury severity, violation of safety gears, alcohol use and rash driving following the implementation of MVA September 2019. Primary care and family physician can play a crucial role in creating public awareness about the personal safety measures, which will help in strengthening of this law to reduce the incidence of RTA and the associated mortality and morbidity.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - CONTEXT: Harmful use of alcohol has led to 1.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases and 1 million injury deaths including road traffic accidents, self-harm, and interpersonal violence. The opportunistic screening can be used to screen for substance abuse in outpatient department (OPD) attendees of primary health-care (PHC) settings in India.     AIMS: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of willingness to quit alcohol use among alcohol users and factors associated with it.     SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in urban PHCs and willingness to quit alcohol was assessed among the alcohol users. Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) scale was used to assess the alcohol use disorder score. Data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and analyzed using STATA version 14.     RESULTS: It is found that two-third of the male OPD patients are using alcohol and 59% of the alcohol users were willing to quit alcohol. Education (adjusted prevalence rate ratio [aPR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-2.9), occupation (aPR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.8), higher AUDIT scores (aPR = 2.7; 95% CI: 2.2-3.5), frequency of alcohol use (aPR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0), and positive family history of alcohol-related illness times (aPR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.0) were significantly associated with willingness to quit alcohol.     CONCLUSION: Two-third of the male OPD patients are using alcohol and 59% of the alcohol users were willing to quit alcohol. Education, occupation, higher AUDIT scores, frequency of alcohol use, and positive family history of alcohol-related illness were significantly associated with willingness to quit alcohol.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: As a pre-emptive measure against the rampaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), the Government of India ordered an unprecedented but imperative step of a nationwide lockdown on 22nd March, 2020. The entire month of April 2020 remained in a complete national lockdown. <br><br>METHODology: We conducted this retrospective study to compare the spectrum and outcome of trauma victims who presented to our emergency department (ED) from April 2020 (lockdown period) to a similar season matched control arm of April 2018 (non-lockdown period). <br><br>RESULTS: Our study groups included 403 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 9.7%) from April 2020 as compared to 667 trauma victims (trauma prevalence: 10.8%) from April 2018 with an absolute decrease of -39.6% during the lockdown month. The intense lockdown resulted in an absolute decrease in the number of road traffic accidents (RTA) (-75.1%), sports-related injuries (-81.8%), bull gore injuries (-64.3%), workplace-related injuries (-50.0%), and fall from height (-3.5%). However, an absolute increase in the number of falls on level ground (FLG) (+95.7%), domestic trauma (+91.4%), and burn (+37.5%) patients were noted during the lockdown period. The proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, as determined by a positive blood alcohol content, was significantly lower in the lockdown period [adjusted OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.17-0.67); p-value: 0.002] as were RTAs [adjusted OR: 0.44 (95% CI: 0.31-0.62); p-value: <0.001], FLG [adjusted OR: 1.87 (95% CI: 1.14-3.06); p-value: 0.0], and head injuries [adjusted OR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.13-0.3); p-value: <0.001]. <br><br>CONCLUSION: During the stringent lockdown period of April 2020, there was a significant absolute decrease in the number of trauma victims, especially RTAs. The intense lockdown resulted in a significant decrease in the proportion of trauma victims under the influence of alcohol, head injuries, fractures, and dislocations.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Behavior pattern influences the risk of unintentional injuries. This study was conducted to identify the pattern of household unsafe behavior in different socioeconomic strata, in Pune city, India. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Behaviors influencing the risk of burn, poisoning, drowning, and road traffic injuries were questioned from 200 randomly selected households. RESULTS: Nearly 28% of the households did not have a separate kitchen, 37.5% cooked at the ground level, 33.5% used a kerosene pressure stove, 12% used unprotected open fire as a source of warmth in winter, and 34.5% stored inflammable substances at home. Ninety one percent of the households reported storing poisonous chemicals in places that could not be locked. In 68.3% of the households with children below five years, these chemicals were kept in places accessible to children. Nearly 21% of the individuals, who could swim, did so in unsafe places and 25.2% of them were not trained in swimming. In 35.5% of the households, children used streets as playgrounds. Among all two-wheeled vehicle riders, 35.6% reported not having a helmet and 57.7% of those who had a helmet did not use it regularly. Socioeconomic status was strongly associated with the unsafe behaviors related to burns, drowning, and road traffic injuries. CONCLUSION: The study identifies the sociocultural and behavioral factors leading to unsafe behaviors, placing individuals at risk of unintentional injuries, which can be used as a first step toward prevention.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Enquiry into unnatural deaths with all its manners being, suicidal, accidental or homicidal depends on circumstantial evidences for acceptable judgment in court of law. <br><br>OBJECTIVEs were to study socio-demographic characteristics of the study and to find out influencing factors, if any, behind these sudden, suspicious, undesirable deaths.     Methods: A record-based, descriptive study with cross-sectional design was conducted for first six months of 2017 in NRS medical college hospital among 1603 unnatural deaths undergone police inquest. Besides the records obtained from medical record section, findings were corroborated from mortuary. Data were analyzed in SPSS 22.0 and Epi Info 7.0.     Results: Mean age of the deceased was 37.18±17.42 years. Regarding cause of injury, more than 1/3rd (36.6%) was attributed to poisoning, followed by burn injury (24.8%), road traffic accidents (22.8%), fall from height (6.9%) and others the rest. Majority (68.3%) died within twenty hours of reaching the health care facility. More than half of the deceased committed suicide followed by accident and suicide the least. Binary logistic regression revealed, unnatural deaths inflicted by selves or others, i.e. suicide or homicide respectively, had statistically significant (p<0.05) association to productive age, urban residence, burn and RTA, longer survival and conservative nature of management.     Conclusions: As suicide was found to comprise lion share of unnatural deaths, development and implementation of addressing the issue at all the levels, starting from individual to community is the need of the hour.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Unnatural deaths claim a substantial number of lives in developing countries like India. Among the various types of deaths RTAs (road traffic accidents) account for majority of deaths followed by poisoning, hanging, burns, snake bite and electrocution. The ratio between homicidal, suicidal and accidental deaths was 5:2:1. Males 2636 (59.6%) were commonly involved as compared to females 1785 (40.3%).The type of unnatural deaths encountered in our study were RTAs 2486 (56.23%), burns289 (6.53%), poisoning 616 (13.93%), hanging 502 (11.35%), snake bite 69 (1.56%), electrocution 38 (0.85%). Poisoning and hanging is the most common method of self destruction followed by burns, drowning. In homicidal deaths multiple injuries were the most common type of death followed by burns. Preventive measures should be adopted wherever possible and prompt steps should be taken to decrease the incidence of road traffic accidents which takes a lion share among the unnatural deaths. The study suggests different measures to check unnatural death to improve the situation. <br><br>KEYWORDS: Unnatural Deaths, Suicide, Autopsy, Urban-Rural Population, Accidents<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Globally, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among those aged 15-29 years. However, road traffic injury research has not received adequate attention from the scientific community in low- and middle-income countries, including India. The present study aims to provide a bibliometric overview of research assessing road traffic injuries in India. <br><br>METHODS: We used Scopus to extract relevant research in road traffic injuries published from 1991 to 2017. This study presented the key bibliometric indicators such as trends of annual publications and citations, top 10 authors, journals, institutions and highly cited articles, citation analysis of articles, co-occurrence of keywords, etc. Analysis was performed using Scopus, Microsoft Excel, and VOS-viewer. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 242 articles were retrieved with an h-index of 18, excluding self-citations. A steadfast growth of publications was documented in last decade, especially after the year 2010. The h-index of the top 10 authors, institutions, journals and highly cited articles did not surpass single digits. A network visualisation map showed that 'traffic accident', 'male', 'adolescent' and 'child' were the most commonly encountered key terms. The prominent authors were Gururaj G, Dandona R, and Hyder AA, whereas the top journals were the Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, Medico Legal Update, and the International Journal of Applied Engineering Research and top institutions were the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and the Administrative Staff College of India. <br><br>CONCLUSION: In India, road traffic injuries research is inadequate in quantity and quality, warranting greater attention from researchers and policy planners to address the burden of road traffic injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Injury prevention is a daunting health challenge as public health systems particularly in the developing world are least prepared to respond to this issue. In 2005, an estimated 5.4 million people worldwide died from injuries over 90 per cent in low- and middle-income countries. The main objective of this bibliometric analysis was to document injury literature published on low- and middle- income countries, and also to quantify literature on road traffic injuries by countries before and after the World Health Day on Road Safety celebrated in April 2004. METHODS: A systematic search was done using MeSH terms on PubMed. Papers on road traffic injuries were assessed by country/cluster and by publication date for two periods (March 2001-March 2004) and (April 2004-April 2007). The rate of articles published per million population was calculated. Finally, a comparison was made between disease burden in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and quantum of papers published. The search was performed on April 29, 2007. RESULTS: PubMed had 8.26 million articles listed; of which, 72 per cent were in English and only 2 per cent were on unintentional injuries. For papers in all languages including English on road traffic injuries, 41 per cent were from US, 36 per cent from Europe (other than Eastern Europe). Two most populous countries, China and India contributed only 0.9 and 0.7 per cent papers on road traffic injuries, respectively. On neoplasm there were 280 articles published per million population whereas for road traffic injuries, rate was 4 articles per million population. Northern Africa, India and China had less than one article on road traffic injuries per 1,000 road traffic related deaths. The percentage change in English papers on road traffic injuries for the period 2004-2007 in comparison to period 2001-2004 was +191 per cent for China, +118 per cent for India, and +106 per cent for Middle East. Unintentional injuries overall represented 18 per cent of the burden in terms of DALYs and represented only 2 per cent of all published articles. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results noticeably reflected the small proportion of papers on injuries, the dominance of US, and the apparent increase in percentage of road traffic injuries papers from low- and middle- income countries after World Health Day on Road Safety in 2004. Policies on injury prevention and safety in developing countries will be effective if based on local evidence and research, and designed to suit the social, political, and economic circumstances found in developing countries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Ocular trauma is a major cause of uniocular blindness in India, with incidence rates ranging from 4.5% to 7.5%.[12] It has significant financial implications and severely affects the physical and psychological well-being of the patient. Occupational eye injuries remain the most common cause of ocular injuries in the Indian rural population and are caused mainly due to agriculture-related work, carpentry, chiseling, and hammering.[13] The majority of patients with a history of workplace-related ocular trauma do not use any protective eye gear, which can prevent or minimize the impact of injuries.[13] The productive age group being more at risk with subsequent loss of work-hours poses significant financial loss to the patient and family.[13] Contrarily, the most common nonoccupational injuries are recreational or sports-related or due to road traffic accidents, assault, and domestic accidents.[24] Common objects that have been implicated are wooden sticks, gully danda, broomstick, knife, scissors, stones, and glass.[5] Firecracker injuries, especially during the Deepavali festival in India, are another cause of OGIs in both adults and children.[6]    A higher incidence of OGI has been noted in all age groups of Indian males except for infants and the elderly. This male preponderance can be explained by increased outdoor activities, involvement in physical violence, and rash driving. Furthermore, in India, boys generally are granted more freedom than girls in addition to preferential approach, especially with regards to treatment, rendering it an important factor for the higher prevalence of reported cases in males.[45]    Ocular trauma has been classified into open globe injury (OGI) (rupture, perforating injury, retained intraocular foreign body, and perforating injury) and closed globe injury (contusion and lamellar laceration).[7] Prognostic factors, which are the major determinants of final visual outcome in OGI...<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - As per estimates, nearly 175,000 (136,900 as per official reports) persons died due to road crashes in India in 2011 along with hospitalisations and disabilities among survivors. More than 70-80% of these deaths and injuries occurred among young people, men and among pedestrians, two wheeler riders and pillions, and cyclists. The economic loss due to road crashes is an estimated $550 billion (INR 55,000 crores) or 3% of GDP (at 2004 prices) every year. Road safety in India requires a scientific approach for making road users safer in all traffic environments considering the limitations of human behaviour. There is need for strong road safety policies and programmes, a lead agency to coordinate activities, capacity strengthening, human resources, dedicated funding, strong advocacy, implementing scientific interventions, along with monitoring and evaluation. The 4'E's of Engineering, Enforcement, Education and Emergency Care need to be addressed through an intersectoral approach. In India, road deaths and other injuries are publicly glaring, while road safety is professionally lacking and politically missing and needs to be corrected for making road environments safer through multipronged approaches.

N2  - <p> At the time of going to press, the world is reeling in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic, and the subject of safety is uppermost on everybody’s mind. Many countries have reported drastic reductions in injuries involving car crashes in the last three weeks. Most of the countries have imposed restrictions on movements and have declared total or partial ‘lockdowns’ during this period. This unprecedented situation across the world has posed new health challenges not experienced or anticipated by anyone. The drastic reduction in traffic injuries should not come as a surprise, since the number of motorised vehicles and other road users have drastically been reduced in this period. However, there are many questions to be answered by researchers on injuries and the adverse impact on health in times of drastic reduction in mobility and economic activities across the globe. We look forward to publishing these studies in our future issues.    The current issue presents a number of studies that contribute much to our common discourse of evidence based research. The submissions range from the WHO in Switzerland, to the countries of Malaysia, the Sultanate of Oman, Kuwait, Poland, Iran, USA, China, India, Spain, Colombia, Serbia, Brazil, Rwanda, and the Czech Republic. It is heartening to note that some of the contributions in the present issue are the joint work of researchers coming together from different countries.    Kaycem Laych, et al., from the World Health Organization in Switzerland, have made a presentation on the urgent need for all countries to improve civil registration data collection on road traffic mortality, as the present state of affairs leaves much to be desired. In order to better perform their tasks, they should adopt a consistent definition of ‘road traffic death’; this is of the utmost importance in recording details in police databases. They should link civil registration records, police data and insurance data. At present, this is a practice followed only in a few countries. It is important to note that the civil registration and vital statistics systems (CRVS) generate records of all officially registered deaths and are not time-limited ...

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries contribute substantially to the disease burden in India. This paper describes the road safety issues discussed by members of the Indian Parliament, and highlights the gaps that need to be addressed to make road safety visible as a public health problem to policy-makers in India. METHODS: All questions asked to and information provided by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, and questions relating to accident asked to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India were reviewed for the two Houses of the Indian Parliament for the years 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Of the 1529 questions asked to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, only 140 (9.1%) were related to road safety, whereas 1076 (70.5%), 181 (11.8%), 51 (3.3%) and 81 (5.3%) were related to other aspects of the national highways, state roads, vehicles and other issues, respectively. Data on the magnitude of road crashes dealt only with the number of crashes and fatalities and not with the age, sex and type of road users affected by road traffic injuries. The parliamentarians were informed that human error was the main cause of road crashes in India; however, the robustness of this information is questionable. Strategies to prevent road crashes focused mainly on training of drivers with little attention to other factors that cause road crashes. The discussion on legislations also focused on drivers, ignoring other road users. Ten of the 4741 questions (0.2%) asked to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare were related to accident, the majority of which were about the setting up of trauma care services. CONCLUSION: An appropriate policy and intervention response by policy-makers is not possible with data that are presented in a manner that do not highlight the true nature of the problem, and are neither comprehensive nor robust. Majority of the proposed road safety interventions by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways are based on the traditional view of human error as a major cause of road crashes highlighting the lack of a scientific public health approach towards prevention of road crashes. It would be useful to build the technical capacity of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in road safety to use the available data more effectively, and to facilitate generation of further relevant data about the magnitude, underlying causes and impact of road traffic injuries, for policy-makers to better understand the critical issues for planning effective road safety policies and interventions to reduce the high burden of mortality and morbidity due to road crashes in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - <p> We need reliable statistics of road traffic injuries for two reasons: first, when such statistics enable comparisons with other health conditions, they allow traffic injuries to be prioritised appropriately on the national policy agenda. Second, detailed and timely statistics provide evidence of the effectiveness of safety measures. The estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Risk Factors, and Injuries Study (GBD) have proven extremely valuable in establishing that traffic injuries are a pressing societal concern in low-income and middle-income countries; however, the large uncertainties in GBD estimates should not be overlooked.    In The Lancet Public Health, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Road Injury Collaborators1 present estimates of road injuries in India from GBD 2017; the implications of the uncertainty in these estimates need to be understood. The key underlying source of mortality data for this study was the national Sample Registration System, which includes verbal autopsy data on cause of death in a state-level representative population.2 GBD 2017 used Sample Registration System data for 2004–13 to estimate 219 000 deaths due to road injuries in India in 2017.1 Although the estimate appears to have a high level of certainty (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 202 000–231 000), comparisons with other analyses that used the same primary data (Sample Registration System 2004–13) reveal that uncertainty is much higher. Menon and colleagues3 estimated 275 000 deaths due to road injuries (95% UI not reported) in 2017, 26% higher than that reported in GBD 2017.1 These varying estimates suggest that the uncertainty in GBD's estimate could be about three times that reported—ie, about 20% higher or lower at the national level, and much higher at the state level where verbal autopsy sample sizes are much smaller. Notably, the primary underlying data are the same in these analyses, and so much of the uncertainty could be due to variations in GBD modelling strategies that are unaccounted for and which are unclear to an external audience ...</p>  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - <p>Went through with interest article entitled “Public health crisis of road traffic accidents in India: Risk factor assessment and recommendations on prevention on behalf of the Academy of Family Physicians of India” published in Journal of Family medicine and primary care (2019; 8:775-83). The authors deserve credit for coming up with recommendations and thereby attracting attention toward road traffic injuries. The Academy of Family Physicians of India needs to build on these recommendations and come out with a framework document on building competency in injury prevention across all healthcare settings in India. As is apparent, developing competency in injury prevention will hold the key to reduce burden because of injuries.    To a complete document already published by the authors in Journal of Family medicine and primary care, this author suggests a few points here to be used in developing a framework depending on our experience with injury research.    The first point is regarding the development of injury registries. Injury registries focusing on Road Traffic Injuries only might lead to a compartmentalized approach to injury prevention. Instead, registering all types of musculoskeletal injuries into a database across medical colleges in India can be an initial step in mitigative research on injuries. This could function on lines similar to hospital-based cancer registries currently functioning across medical colleges in India. An uniform protocol for registering injuries will be useful in understanding pattern, frequency, and trends. Our own experience in this regard has been rewarding as the outcome of this has helped us better understand the pattern of injuries in our part of India. We also found the exercise requiring lesser resource and training, and therefore, feasible in terms of execution.    The second point is regarding the development of prevention models. Research focusing on developing models or matrices for prevention of injuries needs to be taken up. I doubt, there has been a serious effort in this regard, and we continue to depend heavily on Haddon's work in this regard. Locally, relevant models will pave the way in better understanding of injuries and, therefore, prevention. The Academy of Family Physicians of India in collaboration with emergency medicine experts need to assume a leadership role in this as most of the action in preventing injuries will be around families.    In addition, last and important, developing competency in injury prevention will require the active involvement of other important stakeholders such as the lawmakers, educationist, environmentalists, medical professionals, and technocrats among others. Probably, it is time to strengthen the existing competencies and develop newer ones ...</p>  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - This study presents the need for an effective Accident Data System (ADS) to improve road safety in India. The number of road accidents is unacceptably high in India and there is an urgent need to reduce road accidents for improving road safety. A reliable and comprehensive accident database is essential to identify particular safety hazardous locations that are treatable and for which remedial measures can be implemented. Therefore in this study, the need of effective ADS is presented and a critical review of the existing ADS in India is made. The deficiencies of the ADS are identified. In developing countries like India, the road traffic accident database is quite poor. The accident database has been found to be grossly inadequate from the point of view of recommended accident preventive measures. There is a lack of awareness regarding the usefulness of accident data among the different stakeholders. The accident storage and retrieval system is quite poor and not computerized in most of the states. As the data is not computerized, hardly any meaningful accident analysis can be done. There is also a lack of expertise in the field of accident analysis in our country. The dissemination of accident data is also not done scientifically. There is also a need to create a national accident database from which all user agencies can collect data. For scientific road safety countermeasures, it is essential to create awareness amongst different stakeholders on the utility of proper accident database. Thus, this study proposes some measures for improvements in existing ADS in India. It is expected that this study will be useful to improve accident database collection system and to make effective ADS in India. Thus, this study will be useful to improve safety on Indian roads.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic accidents are a major public health concern, resulting in an estimated 1.2 million deaths and 50 million injuries worldwide each year. In the developing world, Traffic Accidents are among the leading cause of death and injury; India in particular experiences the highest rate of such accidents. According to Transport Research Wing, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways [3], road accidents in India, 2012, Between 1970 and 2011, the number of accidents increased 4.4 times accompanied with 9.8 times increase in fatalities and 7.3 times increase in the number of persons injured. Thus, methods to reduce accident severity are of great interest to traffic agencies and the public at large. For this to happen reliable data set is of high importance and there is a huge crisis of accident data in India, hampering safety promotion and remedial activities. In this particular research project, need for big data which is rapidly expanding in Transportation arena for better models, estimation, prediction and prevention to minimize traffic related crashes is discussed. It is high time for extensive data mining and recording techniques are which can boost the existing traffic accident data, for better understanding of high crash locations, reasons for crashes and how these locations can be made crash free for safer livelihood.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - This paper presents an analysis of the fatal crashes that involved public transport buses in Bangalore, India. The study suggests that low floor buses with mechanical doors and segregated pedestrian and bicycle lanes can have a major impact on reducing fatal crashes of bicycles and pedestrians involving buses.And another research paper based on the aim of facilitating a comparative functional analysis of driving assistance systems and infrastructure measures for traffic safety, this paper studies the underlying concepts of safe road design, and derives a general set of traffic safety principles. Road categorization is studied as an important parameter for both road design and route selection that is optimized from a traffic safety perspective and an extended road categorization is proposed. Finally a systematic overview of infrastructure measures is provided, as a basis for a future comparative functional analysis.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - In rapidly developing economies, like urban India, where road traffic injury rates are among the world's highest, the corporate workplace offers a non-traditional venue for road safety interventions. In partnership with a major multinational corporation (MNC) with a large Indian workforce, this study aimed to elicit local employee perspectives on road safety to inform a global corporate health platform. The safety attitudes and behaviours of 75 employees were collected through self-report survey and focus groups in the MNC offices in Bangalore and Pune. Analysis of these data uncovered incongruity between employee knowledge of safety strategies and their enacted safety behaviours and identified local preference for interventions and policy-level actions. The methods modelled by this study offer a straightforward approach for eliciting employee perspective for local road safety interventions that fit within a global strategy to improve employee health. Study findings suggest that MNCs can employ a range of strategies to improve the road traffic safety of their employees in settings like urban India including: implementing corporate traffic safety policy, making local infrastructure changes to improve road and traffic conditions, advocating for road safety with government partners and providing employees with education and access to safety equipment and safe transportation options.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The main aim of this paper is to analyze the road accidents in India at national, state, and metropolitan city level. Analysis shows that the distribution of road accidental deaths and injuries in India varies according to age, gender, month and time. Age group 30-59 years is the most vulnerable population group, though males face higher level of fatalities and injuries than their female counterparts. Moreover, road accidents are relatively higher in extreme weather and during working hours. Analysis of road accident scenario at state and city level shows that there is a huge variation in fatality risk across states and cities. Fatality risk in 16 out of 35 states and union territories is higher than the all India average. Although, burden of road accidents in India is marginally lower in its metropolitan cities, almost 50% of the cities face higher fatality risk than their moffusil counterparts. In general, while in many developed and developing countries including China, road safety situation is generally improving, India faces a worsening situation. Without increased efforts and new initiatives, the total number of road traffic deaths in India is likely to cross the mark of 250,000 by the year 2025. There is thus an urgent need to recognize the worsening situation in road deaths and injuries and to take appropriate action.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - South Africa (SA), as this issue of the SAMJ will highlight, has one of the highest levels of death through injury in the world. We are (or have become) an extremely violent society and much of the injury we experience as a nation derives from interpersonal violence. However, another large component is accidental injury, and within the sphere of accidental injury, traffic death and injury levels in SA stand out internationally.    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), SA is 1 of 10 countries in the world that are collectively responsible for generating some 62% of global traffic deaths annually. The other countries that feature in the top 10, including India, China and the United States, do so mainly because of their huge populations. SA tops the list because our roads and driving behaviour result in more deaths per 100 000 population than most other countries of comparable population size and economic development.    Every emergency room in SA sees high numbers of injured drivers, pedestrians and passengers through its doors every year. Emergency centre staff know first-hand the long-term toll that crashes take on individuals and their families. The majority of SA citizens, however, appear strangely indifferent to high death rates on our roads. In the absence of any convincing leadership around reducing road casualties, this is partly to be expected. However, another reason for our national indifference lies in simple ignorance.    We have no real conviction that things can improve because we are not aware of how they have changed so dramatically in other parts of the world. We have no expectation that anything we do as individuals can make any difference to this national crisis. We have personally survived countless traffic journeys without injury and our familiarity with ‘dangerous’ traffic conditions has bred a strong sense of complacency.    Until national government prioritises casualty reduction efforts, it is unlikely that we will see improvements in education and awareness. However, attitudes to accident prevention can be changed and medical practitioners can play a leading role in this. While we cannot decrease the number of crashes that take place overnight, we can rapidly reduce the risk of serious injury or death in the event of a crash. Here, the medical profession can play a major role....<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - It has been a long haul through the COVID 19 pandemic. Thankfully, it seems to be less impactful in some parts of the world. Many countries have already reduced the restrictions that have so strongly interfered with the lives of so many people. Many efforts are required to establish how, why and to what extent this has affected the society at large. The pandemic has had a major impact on research training and education for medical and health care professionals. The lessons of the last two years will be very important as we move on. This issue presents two important studies documenting the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on traffic safety and a study of violence against women during the COVID 19 pandemic.     Kandaswamy Paramasivan et al., from India have examined the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on road safety in Tamil Nadu. Predicted counterfactuals were used to estimate road traffic crash (RTC), road traffic death (RTD) and road traffic injury (RTI) as if no lockdown was in place. This is then compared with the actual RTC data during the lockdown. The causal inference is studied using a holistic approach by marshalling several methods employed for counterfactual prediction on traffic safety during the lockdown period(s). This complex and nuanced study suggests alternate interventions that could help in framing new policies that are more equitable and holistic.     Wael K. M. Alhajyaseen, et al. from Qatar and Switzerland have made a submission on traffic safety during the Covid-19 pandemic and the public's perception of it. While the total number of crashes during the period under study went down, it must be noted that the number of serious injuries and fatalities increased. In spite of these facts, the public's perception was that the roads became safer and the driving behaviour of the vehicle drivers improved. The experts, who had the facts and figures right, however disagreed that driving behaviour had improved and were clear that the increase in fatal injuries was the result of the government's reduced attention to safety on the roads...

N2  - In referring to injuries of the brain the term, ‘traumatic brain injury’ (TBI) is preferred over the use of the less specific and more generic ‘head injury’. While a skull fracture may suggest the presence of an underlying TBI, the presence of neurological symptoms or the demonstration of intracranial pathology is needed to establish the diagnosis of TBI. TBI need not always be caused by direct trauma to the head.    TBI is an extremely important cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. In the western hemisphere, TBI is the leading cause of mortality in persons under 45. Population-based studies in countries such as South Africa (SA), Taiwan and India suggest even higher rates in developing countries accounted for primarily by road traffic accidents or motor vehicle accidents (MVAs). Indeed, males in South-East Asia and Africa have the highest and second highest incidences of road traffic injury-related fatalities in the world, and it can be assumed that a significant proportion, if not the majority, of these deaths are attributable to TBI. In the United States (US), where the overall incidence of TBI is 506.4 per 100 000 population,2 equating to approximately 1.5 million people suffering a TBI in each year, a number of states undertake TBI surveillance. This TBI surveillance relies largely on hospital admissions for data collection and ignores mild TBI that does not result in a hospital admission or visit. The overall incidence of TBI is therefore probably higher than officially reported, even in the developed world. SA does not have a TBI databank, and contemporaneous studies on the overall incidence and prevalence of TBI are lacking. In 1991, Brown et al. reported an average incidence of 316 brain injuries per 100 000 persons per year. The methodological difficulties in undertaking such a study were well described by the authors. While some of the difficulties alluded to, such as segregated hospitals, no longer apply, others continue to be relevant 22 years later. These include incomplete and unreliable hospital records, poor research (and epidemiological) funding, and overcrowded and poorly resourced public hospitals. A recent developmental accord signed by the national Minister of Health, the Gauteng Health MEC and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand is an encouraging step in the eventual eradication of these persistent shortcomings.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - In 2019, a presentation for a variety of stakeholders was arranged as part of the launch event for a publication documenting the subnational magnitude of road traffic injuries in India as estimated by the Global Burden of Disease Study.1 I did not use the term 'road accident' and explained to the audience the need to move away from that term because accidents do not happen, they are caused. All the questions and comments that followed the presentation used 'road accident'. The same was explained by me in another meeting to a very different audience--researchers at a leading global vehicle manufacturer. After the presentation, the president of the company said that he hoped that I slipped and used 'road accident' at least once during the presentation or interaction, but I did not. He was pleased with my devotion to convey that prevention is possible. And then, he went on to use 'road accident' in his speech. In fact, in my 20 years of work as an injury researcher, I have failed to get the vast majority of the stakeholder not to use 'accident'.     And it is all in the name.     McClure, in his editorial in June 2021,2 invited the Injury Prevention readers to look through that issue from the perspective of a decision-maker to assess if the authors got it right--right enough to make sure people used these results as a basis for their decisions. We did so for the injury research that our team has done over the last two decades which has focused on road traffic injuries and suicides, and with some work on drowning, gender violence and snake bites. Irrespective of the injury that one considers, we have found underreporting of deaths in the official statistics of India, which are generated by the police as injuries are reported as crime in India.3 The government stakeholders involved in addressing injuries are varied and disconnected--the police is under the Ministry of Home Affairs, road traffic safety is under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, and the Ministry of Health predominately deals with cases post injury. Looking back at our work, has our research resulted in any difference in the underreporting? No. Have we managed to integrate the different stakeholders in our research? No. Did the data generate effect on policy or programme? For the most part, no. The data clearly do not speak for themselves...<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Common goods such as air, water, climate, and other resources shared by all humanity are under increasing pressure from growing population and advancing globalization of the world economy. Safeguarding these resources is generally considered a government responsibility, as common goods are vulnerable to market failure. However, governments do not always fulfill this role, and face many challenges in doing so. This observation-that governments only sometimes address common goods problems-informs the central question of this paper: when do governments act in support of common goods? We structure our inquiry using a framework derived from three theories of agenda setting, emphasizing problem perception, the role of actors and collective action patterns, strategies and policies, and catalyzing circumstances. We used a poll of experts to identify important common goods for health: disease surveillance, environmental protection, and accountability. We then chose four historical cases for analysis: the establishment of the Epidemic Intelligence Service in the US, transport planning in London, road safety in Argentina, and air quality control in urban India. Our analysis of the collective evidence of these cases suggests that decisions to advance government action on common goods require a concisely articulated problem, a well-defined strategy for addressing the problem, and leadership backed by at least a few important groups willing to cooperate. Our cases reveal a variety of collective action patterns, suggesting that there are many routes to success. We consider that the timing of an intervention in support of common goods depends on favorable circumstances, which can include a catalyzing event but does not necessarily require one.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background Visit to various 'Safe Community' on a travel fellowship to two Scandinavian countries gave an opportunity to author to conceptualise and replicate the intervention in a developing country where coordination between stakeholders is challenging.    Purpose This paper underscores the problem of accidents in a fast developing urban agglomeration; identifying the opportunities to introduce the interventions to reduce the occurrence of injury in variety of settings, and steps to involve the multiple partners in injury prevention programme.    Methods Author participated in the 4th Travelling Seminar at Karolinska University in 1994. Since then he seized every available opportunity to introduce the 'Safe Community' practices in Jaipur city.    Outcome NGO's working in the field of road traffic accidents was oriented to adopt a logical approach. Traffic Police and Urban Development authorities were persuaded to incorporate the safety prevention measures in launch of new projects. Priority to helmet use by two-wheelers; seat belts in cars; traffic education in schools yielded positive results in reduction of morbidity and mortality. Advocacy measures have paved the way for launch of 'safe community'.    Contribution to the Field In a city where population and area is expanding rapidly, there is an urgent need to introduce the strategies in city planning and management to reduce roadside, schools, and domestic accidents. Capacity gained through participation in a travel fellowship programme was fully exploited over one-and-half decade, the results of which needs to be measure.

N2  - Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion (Safety 2022)    Background Robust, evidence-based legislation is critical to improving road safety. Since 2012, the Global Road Safety Partnership has administered the Road Safety Grants Programme, a key activity within the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety (BIGRS). During that decade, the programme has supported successful road safety policy advocacy campaigns designed to protect road users and improve vehicle safety standards through funding the work of over 120 civil society and government grantees in 18 countries. Estimates suggest that legislative improvements that occurred with support of the grants programme will account for 75% of an estimated 311,758 lives to be saved from the overall initiative by 2030 (Hendrie et al 2021). This demonstrates the importance of the significant contributions made by organizations that have received support from GRSP's Road Safety Grants Programme in their policy advocacy work.     Process Showcasing advocacy successes, this presentation will highlight policy achievements and lessons learnt in supporting in-country advocacy campaigns, including technical assistance needs, effective coalition building and capacity building work.     Outcomes Successes include enactment and implementation of the Land Traffic Law (Cambodia); formulation and implementation of the National Child Helmet Wearing Action Plan (Vietnam); enactment and implementation of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act 2019 (India); passage and implementation of the Child Safety in Motor Vehicles Act 2017 (Philippines); and passage of the General Law of Mobility and Road Safety (Mexico). Effective policy advocacy campaigns promoting passage of evidence-based laws is a critical role for civil society to support governments to address the road trauma burden.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic accidents (RTA) account for a significant proportion of mortality and morbidity worldwide, especially the developing countries. 'Hidden pandemics' such as deaths due to RTA often receive minimal attention globally. If not addressed adequately, the forecast looks bleak, especially for the developing countries in the coming decades. Healthcare professionals have an important role in advocating measures to reduce injuries following RTA and, along with like-minded social individuals, can act as a powerful lobby to implement change. Following a 'Public Interest Litigation or PIL' by the Indian Orthopaedic Association (IOA) in 2012 - which challenged the Government to accept responsibility for this glaring problem and form an apex body to enforce road safety - the Supreme Court of India identified the existing road-safety laws to be inadequate. It created an 'Empowered Committee' which oversaw various new road safety measures implemented by respective state governments. A public movement called 'UYIR' (meaning 'life' in Tamil) was launched at Coimbatore to reduce RTA. Early results following the implementation of this program showed promising results with a reduction in major accidents. It emphasized that well-planned programs involving the general public could be the way forward in reducing accidents across the country. Hence, Social Advocacy is crucial when an individual or group supports and influences political, economic, and social decisions. Such advocacy aims to gain support in an adverse environment to create the necessary change for the better.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Disasters and mass casualty incidents (MCIs) that cause substantial mortality and morbidity have been increasing worldwide. The emergency department (ED) services manage MCIs by optimizing triage and providing health care with required resources. The present study attempted to describe the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of MCIs presenting to the ED. <br><br>METHODS: The present retrospective observational study was conducted at the ED of a tertiary care hospital on patients of MCI for 4 years from 2017 to 2021. The data were extracted from the ED disaster records and other paper-based patient records. Information on patient demography, date and time of arrival, mode of transport, method of arrival (direct or referral), type and mechanism of MCI, ED management, and outcome were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 4.1.0. <br><br>RESULTS: Analysis of 21 MCIs was conducted. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) were the predominant cause of MCIs. The majority of MCI victims, except for those of blast injuries, were men. The victims in medical emergencies were significantly younger than those in other MCI groups (P < 0.001). The majority of patients were brought to ED through ambulance services (n = 120 [47.1%]), followed by private vehicles (n = 112 [44.2%]). Most of the MCI victims (n = 143 [56.2%]) were brought to the ED during evening hours (4 pm-8 pm). The majority of victims belonged to the "Red" triage category (n = 110 [43.3%]). The injury severity score was significantly higher (P = 0.014) in the disaster group than in other trauma MCI groups (20 vs. 17). Autorickshaw occupants were the most common victims of mass casualty RTAs (n = 38 [40%]). Suturing (n = 97 [50%]) and dressing (n = 167 [88%]) were the most common ED procedures required by the victims of trauma MCIs. Of the total, 167 (66%) patients were discharged from the ED, 47 (19%) patients were admitted to wards, 13 (5%) patients were admitted to intensive care units, and 24 (9%) patients got referred to other centers. In addition, two patients died in the ED during treatment, whereas one patient was brought dead. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: RTAs dominate the MCIs and are affecting the young producative male population. The present study exhibited the severity of the cases in MCIs and their impact in the health-care setting, therefore signifying the importance of standardized MCI management protocols.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Maxillofacial Injury (MFI) is a major public health concern that is multifactorial in etiology-road traffic accidents (RTAs), falls and violence. RTAs are the major cause of maxillofacial injuries (MFIs) in countries like India. Recent studies have shown that maxillofacial fractures (MFF) constitute a significant proportion of facial injuries seen in hospitals (56.5%). The incidence of maxillofacial fractures can vary depending on several factors, including age, gender, and environmental factors. Of particular concern is the impact of seasonal variations, such as the monsoon season, which lead to high incidence of maxillofacial fractures due to hazardous conditions. <br><br>METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was done in a tertiary-care dental teaching hospital was done. <br><br>RESULTS: Data of 200 subjects including 154 males (77%) and 46 females (23%) with a mean age of 35.38 ± 16.541 years; age range: 1 - 80 years was analyzed. A total of 200 MFI's were recorded between 2021 and 2022. Soft tissue injuries were reported in 37.5% of the cases in non-monsoon season and 42.3% of the cases during the monsoon season. Dentoalveolar fractures were reported in 6.2% of the cases during the non-monsoon seasons and 7.7% during the monsoon season. In this study, mandible was the most fractured bone (n=104,52%) followed by zygomatic complex (n=50, 25%). The frequently observed pattern among mandibular fracture was condyle 8.3% during the non-monsoon season and 2.9% during the monsoon season). <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that mandibular fractures are most commonly seen in maxillofacial fractures, followed by fractures of the zygomatic complex. The study also reveals a higher incidence of soft tissue injuries and dentoalveolar fractures during the monsoon season. Further research is warranted to explore the factors that contribute to the seasonal variation in maxillofacial fractures for effective interventions to reduce their occurrence.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: The 550th Birth Anniversary (Parkash Utsav) celebrations of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Sikh Guru, was celebrated with great devotion and fervor at Sultanpur Lodhi, Punjab, India, from November 1 to 14, 2019. The authors aimed to shed light on the planning and management of the event and the factors that led to its success. <br><br>METHODS: The researchers conducted key informant interviews with authority figures, resource mapping, and observations. The researchers focused on the event's medical lounge. Open-ended questions were asked to gather information regarding various measures taken to organize and execute the event. The data were entered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 7.0 and SPSS 20.0 (Trial version). <br><br>RESULTS: About three million people attended the Parkash Utsav 550 celebrations. Three tent cities were set up in Sultanpur Lodhi with the consideration for incoming road traffic. The state government deployed 820 medical personnel, including 150 doctors, 470 paramedics, and 200 volunteers. A total of 19,521 patients were seen in the outpatient department of the Medical Lounge. The government made sufficient arrangements for various services, such as drinking water, langar (or community kitchens), sanitation, and security. Approximately 37 langar halls were constructed in the town to provide healthy food to the devotees. An integrated command and control center was set up for surveillance and monitoring. For the convenience of the devotees, 1,908 toilets, 1,476 urinals, and 132 bathing units were installed. The District Administration of Kapurthala launched an event-specific mobile application, "Par-kash Utsav 550," for the use of pilgrims as well as government officials. No stampedes, outbreaks, and fire incidents were reported. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Parkash Utsav 550 was successfully celebrated. Studying the Parkash Utsav 550 presented a unique opportunity to generate an evidence base for the development of solutions and recommendations for the prevention, management, and control of infectious diseases, stampedes, and fire incidents during mass gatherings. In-depth studies of the Parkash Utsav in the future are required to produce evidence for context-specific measures for addressing the complex health challenges of mass gatherings.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background Professional drivers have a powerful impact on public safety. They are also at a higher risk of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of their lifestyle. Diabetes and its complications can affect driving and cause increased road traffic accidents. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of T2DM and determine the risk factors contributing to the development of T2DM among professional drivers in the Perambalur Municipality of Tamil Nadu, India. <br><br>METHODology This cross-sectional study was carried out between September 2022 and December 2022 among 118 private bus drivers and full-time, professional, three-wheeler drivers in the Perambalur Municipality. A pre-tested semi-structured proforma was used to collect information on the driver's socio-demographic profile and to inquire about their diabetes history, which was verified with their records. We elicited the risk factors of T2DM among those drivers. We recorded the anthropometric measurements and blood pressure. Data analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 (Released 2012; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). <br><br>RESULTS Out of 118 study participants, the majority were in the age group of 51-65 (37.3%). Seventy-seven of the participants have completed their secondary education, and 38 of them belong to the class 2 socioeconomic class. Three-fourths of the sample (83.1%) belonged to nuclear families. Around one-third were current smokers, one-fourth had the habit of chewing tobacco, and more than half of the participants consumed alcohol. Nearly 83.7% had moderate physical activity, followed by 11.9% who had heavy activity, and 5.1% who did not do any physical activity. The prevalence of T2DM among professional drivers was 11.9%. The risk factors that contributed to the development of T2DM among professional drivers were age, education, smoking, tobacco chewing, hypertension, elevated BMI, and elevated WC, which are statistically significant (p˂0.05). <br><br>CONCLUSION We found the proportion of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes to be higher among professional drivers than among the general population. This demands an urgent need for preventive and health-promotive interventions to address these chronic diseases.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The interactions of motorised vehicles with pedestrians have always been a concern in traffic safety. The major threat to pedestrians comes from the high level of interactions imposed in uncontrolled traffic environments, where road users have to compete over the right of way. In the absence of traffic management and control systems in such traffic environments, road users have to negotiate the right of way while avoiding conflict. Furthermore, the high level of movement freedom and agility of pedestrians, as one of the interactive parties, can lead to exposing unpredictable behaviour on the road. Traffic interactions in uncontrolled mixed traffic environments will become more challenging by fully/partially automated driving systems' deployment, where the intentions and decisions of interacting agents must be predicted/detected to avoid conflict and improve traffic safety and efficiency. This study aims to formulate a game-theoretic approach to model pedestrian interactions with passenger cars and light vehicles (two-wheel and three-wheel vehicles) in uncontrolled traffic settings. The proposed models employ the most influencing factors in the road user's decision and choice of strategy to predict their movements and conflict resolution strategies in traffic interactions. The models are applied to two data sets of video recordings collected in a shared space in Hamburg and a mid-block crossing area in Surat, India, including the interactions of pedestrians with passenger cars and light vehicles, respectively. The models are calibrated using the identified conflicts between users and their conflict resolution strategies in the data sets. The proposed models indicate satisfactory performances considering the stochastic behaviour of road users - particularly in the mid-block crossing area in India - and have the potential to be used as a behavioural model for automated driving systems.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Globally, the increase in pedestrian fatalities due to road traffic crashes (RTCs) on transport networks has been a major concern. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), pedestrians face a high risk due to RTCs on the rural highway network. The safety evaluation methods, such as observational before-after, empirical Bayes, full Bayes, and cross-sectional methods have been used to identify risk factors of RTCs. However, these methods are data-intensive and have associated limitations. Thus, this study employed a matched case-control method to identify the risk factors of fatal pedestrian crashes. This study utilized crash, traffic volume, speed, geometric, and roadside environment data of a 175 km six-lane rural highway in India. The identified major risk factors, such as clear zone width, the presence of habitation, service roads, and horizontal curve sections, increase the likelihood of a fatal pedestrian crash. This study provides specific insights for modifying the speed limit of highway sections passing through habitation. On such highway sections, designers should shift focus to pedestrian safety. It also suggests that the service road design needs to be reconsidered from a pedestrian safety viewpoint. The proposed method can be used in any other setting having similar traffic and socio-economic conditions.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic is the major source of noise pollution leading to human health impacts in urban areas. This study presents the relation between changes in human brain waves due to road traffic noise exposure in heterogeneous conditions. The results are based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 12 participants through a listening experience of traffic scenarios at 14 locations in New Delhi, India. Energetic, spectral and temporal characteristics of the noise signals are presented. The impact of noise events on spectral perturbations and changes in the relative power (RP) of EEG signals are evaluated. Traffic noise variations modulate the rate of change in α and θ EEG bands of temporal, parietal and frontal lobe of the brain. The magnitude of event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) increases with each instantaneous increase in traffic noise, such as honking. Individual noise events impact the temporal lobe more significantly in quieter locations compared with noisy locations. Increase in loudness changes the RP of α band in frontal lobe. Increase in temporal variation due to intermittent honking increases the RP of θ bands, especially in right parietal and frontal lobe. Change in sharpness leads to variation in the RP of right parietal lobe in theta band. Whereas, inverse relation is observed between roughness and the RP of right temporal lobe in gamma band. A statistical relationship between noise indicators and EEG response is established.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: In context of increasing traffic noise in urban India, the objective of the research study is to assess noise due to heterogeneous traffic conditions and the impact of honking on it. <br><br>METHOD: Traffic volume, noise levels, honking, road geometry and vehicular speed were measured on national highway, major and minor roads in Nagpur, India. <br><br>RESULTS: Initial study showed lack of correlation between traffic volume and equivalent noise due to some factors, later identified as honking, road geometry and vehicular speed. Further, frequency analysis of traffic noise showed that honking contributed an additional 2 to 5 dB (A) noise, which is quite significant. Vehicular speed was also found to increase traffic noise. Statistical method of analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirms that frequent honking (p < 0.01) and vehicular speed (p < 0.05) have substantial impact on traffic noise apart from traffic volume and type of road. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that honking must also be a component in traffic noise assessment and to identify and monitor "No Honking" zones in urban agglomerations.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Surrogate safety measure (SSM)-based proactive safety assessment in developing economies like India with weak lane discipline mixed traffic conditions is limited and often lacks qualitative aspects of reliability. On further investigation, challenges of data acquisition, the viability of a specific SSM, the corresponding threshold value for the identification of conflict, and availability of reliable road crash data are observed to be the key hurdles in achieving robust results and proposing measures for mitigating rear-end conflicts and risks of crashes. The present study highlights the hurdles in performing the safety assessment for rear-end conflicts in mixed traffic conditions with weak lane discipline and proposes possible measures to overcome these hurdles.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Interest has grown in using traffic conflicts for studying safety from a broader perspective than relying only on collision data. Traffic conflict analysis is typically performed through the calculation of traditional conflict severity measures such as time-to-collision and postencroachment time. These measures rely on road users getting within specific temporal and spatial proximity from each other and therefore assume that proximity is the surrogate for severity. However, this assumption may not be valid in some driving environments where close interactions between road users are common and sudden evasive actions are frequently used to avoid collisions. It is suggested that evasive action-based conflict indicators can assess the analysis in some less-organized traffic environments. This study focused on the severity evaluation of pedestrian conflicts. Pedestrian evasive actions were reflected mainly in variations of spatiotemporal gait parameters (step frequency and step length). The objective was to compare the use of time proximity and evasive action-based conflict indicators in evaluating the severity of pedestrian conflicts in different traffic environments. Video data from intersections in five major cities--Shanghai, China; New Delhi, India; New York City; Doha, Qatar; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada--were analyzed with automated computer vision techniques to extract pedestrian-involved conflicts and calculate conflict indicators. <br><br>RESULTS show that evasive action-based indicators were more effective in identifying and measuring the severity of pedestrian conflicts than time proximity measures in traffic environments such as Shanghai and New Delhi. However, evasive action measures did not show the same potential in Vancouver and Doha, where time proximity measures were more effective.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background Distracted driving is a major public health concern. Distraction results in reduced speed control, lateral lane position, reduced situational awareness, and impaired response times to roadway hazards. Visual, cognitive, and manual distractions impair drivers in different ways. With the above background, this study was conducted with the objective of estimating the proportion of distracted driving behavior and its predictors among the adult population in the Perambalur district, Tamil Nadu, India, by using the Total Distracted Driving Scale. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among 403 adults aged 18 years and above by convenience sampling technique in the Perambalur district for six months. A pretested, semi-structured proforma was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education, and occupation. To quantify distracted driving behavior, the Total Distracted Driving Scale was used. This scale contains seven questions about talking on the phone, five questions about texting, and five questions about using specific devices while driving. Data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 21. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the distracted driving behavior with respect to each variable, and to find out the significance, a corresponding statistical test was employed. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <br><br>RESULTS The mean age of the study participants was 24.86 ± 10.63 years. More than half of the study subjects (52.4 percent) were females, and around 87.3 percent of them were Hindu by religion. Among the study participants, around 66.74 percent mentioned that they had used a cell phone while driving. Around 38 percent of the study participants admitted that they had been in or were near-crash circumstances during the past year. Around 87 percent of the study participants who had a crash or near-crash in the past year admitted that they had been distracted while driving. On primary analysis, religion of individuals and increased driving frequency had a statistically significant association with a history of distracted driving. Study participants who were using three- and four-wheelers and those who used cellphones while driving had a statistically significant association with a history of distracted driving. According to the regression, cell phone users are 3.915 times more distracted than those who do not use cellphones (p = 0.001). Subjects with a history of crashes or near-crashes were 56.96 times more distracted than those without a history (p < 0.001). <br><br>CONCLUSION In the present study, three-fourths of the study population used a cell phone while driving. More than three-fourths of the study participants admitted that they had been in a crash or near-crash circumstances during the past year. Distracted driving was responsible for four-fifths of all crashes or near-collisions. Use of a cell phone while driving and a history of near-crashes have a higher risk of distraction than those who do not.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The study explores the effect of drivers' risk perception and perception of driving tasks on road safety attitude. A sample of 1500 drivers, 500 each from three districts of Fatehabad, Gurgoan and Rohtak of Haryana in India has been used in the study. The primary data of 500 drivers of Fatehabad district was subjected to exploratory factor analysis which extracted eight factors from 39 items of the questionnaire. The factors were further subjected to confirmatory factor analysis on the data of 1000 drivers of Gurgaon and Rohtak districts for validating constructs of risk perception, perception of driving tasks, and road safety attitude encompassing five factors of traffic rules, aggressive behavior, non-driving activities/distraction, driving responsibility and carelessness. Structural equation modeling has been applied to find the effect of drivers' risk perception and perception of driving tasks on road safety attitude. The study has observed a significant positive correlation between drivers' risk perception and perception of driving tasks and found that both the perceptions significantly affect drivers' road safety attitude. Risk perception partially mediates the relationship.     Copyright © 2016, Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The study is based on a sample of 500 drivers taken from Rohtak district of Haryana in India. The four constructs viz. Traffic Rules (TR), Driving Responsibility (DR), Non-Driving Activities (NDA) and Risk Perception (RP) of study are defined by 21 items of the questionnaire. Structural equation modelling has been used to analyse the data. The results of the study indicate that there is significant effect of risk perception on drivers' attitude regarding NDA, driving responsibility and traffic rules. Traffic rules significantly directly and indirectly impact NDA. Driving responsibility and NDA are directly influenced by traffic rules. Driving responsibility directly affects NDA. Statistical properties are satisfactory to examine the effect of drivers' risk perception on safe driving attitude. The results of the study suggest that the state transport departments' focus on the risk perception of road accidents in driving training program can help in modifying drivers' attitude regarding safe driving.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - This paper proposes a novel approach for examining rear-end collisions between successive vehicles in a traffic stream. In this approach, a new safety measure of the follower driver's attentiveness is proposed, referred to herein as instantaneous heeding time (IHT), reflecting the subject follower's heeding nature concerning its leader. A safety framework that integrates the IHT with the distance gap and the instantaneous follower's speed is presented. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated using an Indian-traffic trajectory database (developed in this study) and the homogeneous traffic database of the next generation simulation (NGSIM) project developed in the United States (U.S.). Five study sections in India and two study sections in the U.S. are analyzed for three traffic-flow levels. For Indian traffic, the results show that motorized two-wheelers (MTW) have degraded road safety due to the unrestrained lateral crisscross movements. Due to the presence of MTW, the Indian-traffic stream operates in a disorderly fashion, thereby increasing the probability of rear-end collisions with other vehicle classes. Further, the importance of implementing cautioning measures for drivers that reduce the probability of collisions is demonstrated. Besides, the NGSIM application results confirmed the proposed framework's applicability to both Indian and homogeneous traffic conditions. In practice, the proposed framework can be used in real-time to monitor the driver's aggressive instincts.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Using cell phones while driving contribute to distractions which can potentially cause minor or major road traffic injuries and also stress among other drivers. With this background, the study was done to ascertain the proportion of handheld cell phone use while driving among road users in Mysore city and also patterns of the use by the day of week, type of road, and type of vehicle. <br><br>METHODS: The study was conducted in Mysore, Karnataka, India. Four stretches of roads were observed thrice daily for 1 week. The total number of vehicles passing through the stretch and the number and characteristics of drivers using hand-held cell was noted. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to ascertain the significance of the difference in proportions. <br><br>RESULTS: The overall proportion of cell phone users was calculated as 1.41/100 vehicles. The observed use of handheld cell phones was 1.78 times higher on nonbusy roads than busy roads (<i>Χ</i><sup>2</sup>= 25.79,<i>P</i>< 0.0001). More than 50% of the handheld phone users were driving a two wheeler, the proportion being 50.5% in busy roads, and 67% in nonbusy roads. There was no difference in the proportion of cell phone use by time of the day or across different days of the week. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of drivers who use cell phones is found to be relatively lower, and use of cell phones was higher on nonbusy roads.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - In India, the crossing conflicts between right-turn vehicles of minor road traffic and conflicting vehicles on major roads have become more severe at unsignalized T-intersections in recent times. Due to the rapid growth of vehicular traffic, including motorized two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, etc., results in an increase in right-turn crossing conflicts (RTCC) at unsignalized T-intersections. The severity of right-turn vehicles is related to the characteristics of both right-turning and conflicting through vehicles. Therefore, this study examines the effect of vehicle types on RTCC. The RTCC are observed using time-to-collision (TTC), at five unsignalized T-intersections in three different cities in India. The RTCC are categorized into critical RTCC and non-critical RTCC based on TTC threshold values obtained by the k-means clustering algorithm. A Generalized Poisson Regression model was developed using Python software. The study results revealed that the presence of higher composition of two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, and cars in right-turn and conflicting through vehicles significantly influences the severity of RTCC. Also, the model results concluded that the speeds of right-turn and conflicting through vehicles, conflicting through traffic, right-turn traffic, vehicle gap, waiting time, and abnormal driving paths significantly affect the RTCC at unsignalized T-intersections. The findings of this study help traffic engineers and safety experts identify the critical unsignalized T-intersections using the number of right-turn crossing conflicts.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Pedestrians continue to face high risk of getting involved in fatal and serious injury crashes all over the world. In many high-income countries, pedestrian involvement in fatal crashes occur mostly in urban areas. However, in many low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, pedestrian involvement in fatal crashes occur on intercity highways too. This research analyses fatal pedestrian crash characteristics, and identifies probable contributory factors to pedestrian involvement in fatal crashes using logistic regression for two-, four-, and six-lane National Highways. The fatal pedestrian crash density is found to be the highest at 1.37 crashes/km/year on six-lane divided NH-1. The binary logistic regression estimation results for pedestrian involvement in the fatal crash model revealed that the predictors: "number of lanes" and "time of crash" are found to be significant at 95% level. The model results for the variable "number of lanes" highlights the need to study pedestrian crossing behaviour on highways in detail. The design standards for pedestrian crossing facilities in urban areas may not be suitable for National Highways in particular multi-lane highways. In-depth research is required to understand the suitability of various traffic calming measures and other possible interventions which can ensure pedestrian safety on highways.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Traffic signs play a crucial role in managing traffic on the road, disciplining the drivers, thereby preventing injury, property damage, and fatalities. Traffic sign management with automatic detection and recognition is very much part of any Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In this era of self-driving vehicles, calls for automatic detection and recognition of traffic signs cannot be overstated. This paper presents a deep-learning-based autonomous scheme for cognizance of traffic signs in India. The automatic traffic sign detection and recognition was conceived on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- Refined Mask R-CNN (RM R-CNN)-based end-to-end learning. The proffered concept was appraised via an innovative dataset comprised of 6480 images that constituted 7056 instances of Indian traffic signs grouped into 87 categories. We present several refinements to the Mask R-CNN model both in architecture and data augmentation. We have considered highly challenging Indian traffic sign categories which are not yet reported in previous works. The dataset for training and testing of the proposed model is obtained by capturing images in real-time on Indian roads. The evaluation results indicate lower than 3% error. Furthermore, RM R-CNN's performance was compared with the conventional deep neural network architectures such as Fast R-CNN and Mask R-CNN. Our proposed model achieved precision of 97.08% which is higher than precision obtained by Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN models.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The present study focuses on understanding the behavior of motorized 2-wheeler (MTW) riders at urban unsignalized intersections in India. In the Indian context, over 60% of road crash fatalities are attributed to vulnerable road users, with MTWs serving as the predominant contributors, accounting for 44% of total fatalities. Notably, unsignalized intersections have emerged as critical sites for accidents involving vulnerable road users. <br><br>METHODS: Postencroachment time is used to assess traffic conflicts of MTW users. Furthermore, the study employs the exceedance property of extreme value theory to calculate crash probabilities. Tobit and grouped random parameters Tobit regression models are developed to model crash probabilities, incorporating variables such as traffic volume, traffic composition, gap acceptance time, intersection characteristics, and intersection conflict area at 4 urban unsignalized intersections in Surat, India. <br><br>RESULTS: MTW riders have the lowest gap acceptance time among vehicles in the traffic stream. Cars and other heavy vehicles readily accept gaps when MTWs are in the conflicting stream at unsignalized intersections, which increases traffic conflicts. MTWs have the highest crash rates in the traffic stream. Among the developed models, the grouped random parameters Tobit regression captures the spatial unobserved heterogeneity of the study sites and outperforms the simple Tobit regression model. The results also indicate that MTW riders are exposed to a higher risk of crashes while turning at unsignalized intersections. The presence of a central traffic island has varied implications; it raises crash rates at 3-legged intersections but lowers them at 4-legged intersections for 2-wheelers. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The study concludes that MTW crash rates are influenced by traffic and intersectional factors. Increased gap acceptance time correlates with lower crash rates. Countermeasure selections require detailed investigations, because it was observed that the presence of central traffic islands has varied effects on crash rates at 3-legged and 4-legged unsignalized intersections.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Nowadays, there is an increasing trend in the use of information and communication technology devices in new vehicles. Due to these increasing service facilities, driver distraction has become a major concern for transportation safety. To reduce safety risks, it is crucial to understand how distracting activities affect driver behavior at different levels of vehicle control. The objective of this work is to understand how the vehicle and driver characteristics influence mobile phone usage while driving and associated risk perception of road safety incidents. Based on literature review, a man-machine framework for distracted driving and a mobile phone distraction model is presented. The study highlights the findings from a questionnaire survey conducted in Kerala, India. The questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale. Responses from 1203 four-wheeler drivers are collected using random sampling approach. The questionnaire items associated with three driver-drive characteristics are: (i) Human Factors (age, experience, emotional state, behavior of driver), (ii) Driver space (meter, controls, light, heat, steering, actuators of vehicle), (iii) Driving conditions (speed, distance, duration, traffic, signals). This mobile phone distraction model is tested using structural equation modeling procedure. The study indicates that among the three characteristics, 'Human Factors' has the highest influence on perceived distraction due to mobile phones. It is also observed that safety risk perception due to mobile phone usage while driving is moderate. The practical relevance of the study is to place emphasis on behavior-based controls and to focus on strategies leveraging perception of distraction due to mobile phones while driving.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

Method  Commercial vehicle drivers with a minimum of 5 years driving experience were administered STOPBANG questionnaire for identification of risk of OSA. Driving history and details related to collisions were elicited using a questionnaire. Anthropometric measures, visual and auditory reaction times were assessed.     Results  Based on the questionnaire, 35% of the drivers were at risk for OSA. Drivers with high risk of OSA showed reduced auditory reaction time. Anthropometric measurements of the drivers with risk of OSA were significantly higher from those without OSA. There was no significant correlation between OSA and collisions.     Conclusion  Prevalence of risk for OSA is high among commercial vehicle drivers, however it not the single risk factor contributing to collisions. OSA along with reduced reaction time could probably increases the risk of vehicular collisions.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) for male permanent driving license (DL) applicants of Lucknow, India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional community based, study body mass index, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure of each subject were determined as an anthropometric parameter along with the history of habit of smoking, tobacco chewing, alcohol consumption. STOP-Bang (Snoring, Tired or sleepy, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index, Age, Neck, Gender) Questionnaire - a scoring risk assessment tool - was applied for assessment of OSA risk (high OSA risk defined by score ≥ 3) for 542 male DL recipients at 2 Regional Transport Office (RTO) centers in Lucknow, India. The statistical software SPSS 17.0 was applied to the testing. <br><br>RESULTS: In total 23% (N = 125) of participants were found with the risk of OSA. High blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) was found for the maximum number of participants (40.5%) followed by neck circumference > 40 cm (17.1%), age (> 50 years old) (15.3%), snoring (12.3%) and tired/sleepy (10.5%). Mean values of age, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were observed significantly higher (p < 0.001) for participants with the OSA risk. In this population the risk of OSA risk (STOP-Bang score ≥ 3) was observed for 6.7% of young (< 35 years old), 34% of middle (35-45 years old) and 73% of elder age adults (> 45 years old). <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: In view of findings of this study a high number of male driving license applicants were observed with the risk of OSA. Therefore efforts should be made to develop a national screening guideline/protocol for the OSA risk assessment for driving license applicants in India. This may reduce the possibility of road traffic accidents due to the OSA-associated fatigue and drowsiness behind the wheels. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2018;31(1).<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of refractive error (RE) and its association with road traffic accidents (RTAs) and the subsequent long-term spectacle compliance and adherence to suggested appropriate strategies In Shillong, India. <br><br>METHODS: THIS: prospective study was conducted between July and October 2019 among commercial taxi drivers (CTDs), with follow-up interviews conducted with a subset of respondents to assess long-term spectacle compliance after a year. Gross ophthalmologic examination was performed, including visual acuity and refraction. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were conducted to assess the association between the type of REs, spectacle compliance, and selected sociodemographic and clinical variables. Multiple logistic regression was performed for analysis of the association between RTAs and sociodemographic, clinical, and work characteristics variables. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 382 (95.5%) CTDs completed interviews and gross eye examination. The prevalence of any RE in the worst eye was 28.8% (95% CI: 24.3-33.6). Presbyopia with or without distance vision was the commonest type of RE with 21.7% (95% CI: 17.7%-26.2). Among those who were prescribed spectacles, 70.5% needed near correction. Drivers with RE were nearly two times (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.4-5.1) more likely to be involved in RTAs compared to those without any RE. Long-term spectacle compliance was at 40.9%. The predominant barrier reported for spectacle compliance was "can manage well without spectacles." CONCLUSION: This survey has demonstrated a significant relationship between poor vision and occurrence of RTAs. There is an urgent need for tailor-made targeted interventions to address the eye health needs of CTDs in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - <b>Objective:</b> Research has shown that perceived risk is a vital variable in the understanding of road traffic safety. Having experience in a particular traffic environment can be expected to affect perceived risk. More specifically, drivers may readily recognize traffic hazards when driving in their own world region, resulting in high perceived risk (the expertise hypothesis). Oppositely, drivers may be desensitized to traffic hazards that are common in their own world region, resulting in low perceived risk (the desensitization hypothesis). This study investigated whether participants experienced higher or lower perceived risk for traffic situations from their region compared to traffic situations from other regions. <b>Methods:</b> In a crowdsourcing experiment, participants viewed dashcam videos from four regions: India, Venezuela, United States, and Western Europe. Participants had to press a key when they felt the situation was risky. <b>Results:</b> Data were obtained from 800 participants, with 52 participants from India, 75 from Venezuela, 79 from the United States, 32 from Western Europe, and 562 from other countries. The results provide support for the desensitization hypothesis. For example, participants from India perceived low risk for hazards (e.g., a stationary car on the highway) that were perceived as risky by participants from other regions. At the same time, support for the expertise hypothesis was obtained, as participants in some cases detected hazards that were specific to their own region (e.g., participants from Venezuela detected inconspicuous roadworks in a Venezuelan city better than did participants from other regions). <b>Conclusion:</b> We found support for the desensitization hypothesis and the expertise hypothesis. These findings have implications for cross-cultural hazard perception research.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Preceding research has linked noise exposure, road traffic bring the dominant community source, with annoyance, which is an indicator of more serious, chronic health conditions. This study aimed to explore the association between residential road traffic noise and self-reported annoyance from an adult Indian population, residing close to roadways. The cross-sectional study used a questionnaire survey in an urban Indian municipality along roadways, where faηade noise assessment was made manually. The survey included randomly selected subjects aged 19-59 years, residing minimum of 10 years in the area and residing within 50 m of the roadways. Association of self-reported annoyance and noise exposure was examined by binary and multiple logistic regressions. The noise exposure was classified in units of 5 dB (A) from <65 dB (A) to 80 dB (A). Self-reported annoyance was marked at levels above 65-70 dB (A). A 67.5 dB (AA) is suggested as a threshold level. The association was statistically significant for female subjects with the adjusted odds ratio being 2.35 (95% confidence intervals: 0.99-5.58). Prevalence of annoyance was more for male subjects. Both age and period of residence were significant predictors of annoyance. Vulnerable age sub-groups were 34-40 years, followed by 50-60 years. The results of this study further suggest the association residential noise exposure near roadways and self-reported annoyance, among the study subjects.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The present study is aimed to investigate the impact of noise pollution on residents/community residing near roadside. The degree of annoyance was assessed by means of a questionnaire. It was found that among all noise-generating sources, road traffic was the major source of noise followed by factory/machines. A health survey reported about 52% of population was suffering by frequent irritation. 46% respondent felt hypertension, and 48.6% observed loss of sleep due to noise pollution. Common noise descriptors were also recorded at all the selected sites. It was found that the Leq values were higher (range 73-86) compared to the permissible values (65 dBA) prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi. Further, regression equations were developed between various noise indices and percentage of population highly annoyed, and a strong correlation was also observed.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road crashes and environmental degradation are among the prominent issues of concern today in most of the developing economies particularly India. Buses, which are key mode of public transit in India, are unfortunately involved in a significant number of crashes in recent time. Bus driver's attitude and his ability to comprehend traffic situations aptly contributes largely to passenger safety. In this study the effect of sensation seeking behavior on crash involvement rates of bus drivers in India was investigated. Study was conducted to assess sensation seeking behaviors of sample bus drivers from Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). Assessment was conducted using a modified Zuckerman's Sensation seeking scale (ZSSS) form V questionnaire that included sub scales such as boredom susceptibility, disinhibition, experience seeking, and thrill and adventure seeking. The survey results were further related to their crash involvement histories through ratio analysis. Further a Generalized Linear Model with log link and Poisson error was developed to ascertain the influence of these traits on their crash involvement propensity. The results indicate that acute levels of Sensation seeking increased crash involvement rate in the tested drivers. Risk of severe crashes (major and fatal) was observed to be high in drivers with high levels of sensation seeking. Extreme levels of boredom susceptibility and disinhibition, and lower levels of thrill and adventure seeking were found to be dangerous in terms of road crash tendencies. These results highlight the importance of driver behaviour on road safety and also validate the use of ZSSS in behavioural studies of Indian bus drivers. Also, the need for setting efficient standards for behavioral evaluation, necessary for the scrutiny of transport vehicle drivers during their licensing and recruitment process in India has been stressed upon. Through this study it would also help in monitoring road safety attitude in transport vehicle drivers and help in reducing road fatalities and other related losses. Some specific recommendations with respect to KSRTC Bus drivers have been made in this paper in this regard.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - AIM: The aim was to determine the epidemiology of ocular trauma in a large teaching hospital in northern India over 4 years from 2010 to 2014. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, hospital-based, observational study was conducted at the Ophthalmology and Emergency Outpatient Departments of S. S. Hospital, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, from March 2012 to February 2016. Detailed history was taken with special consideration to time, place and session of trauma, mode of injury, and type and nature of traumatic agent. All patients were thoroughly examined as per the standard clinical procedures to identify the type, extent, and severity of injury and impact on ocular structure and vision. Follow-up period was 6 months. Statistical analysis was based on age, sex, residence, marital status, occupation, per capita income, type of trauma and nature of damage, etc. <br><br>RESULTS: Out of 402 patients, 293 (72.9%) were male and 109 (27.1%) were female. Overall male-to-female sex ratio was 2.7:1. Patients were aged between 2 and 70 years (mean: 26.48 ± 15.88, median: 23 years). The most vulnerable age group was 6-15 years (24.38%) followed by 16-25 years (23.88%). Maximum patients belonged to rural background (61.94%). The extent of ocular trauma was 3.93% (95% confidence interval: 3.23-4.63). Majority of participants were single (78.11%) and rest were married. About 112 (27.9%) participants were illiterate and 24.4% had primary education only. One hundred and eighty-eight (46.8%) participants belonged to lower and lower middle socioeconomic status. The cases were clustered in Rs. 1000-5000 per capita income. Most of the injuries occurred in summer season (46.18%) and in afternoon between 12.00 and 17.59 h (48.8%). Majority of trauma occurred away from home (66.20%) mainly on street (28.6%) and playground (9.2%). The most common injury was nonoccupational (82.3%) including sports related (23.9%) and road traffic accident (23.6%). Mechanical injuries were accounted for 89.3% of all eye injuries, and most common source was wooden object (24.9%) followed by metallic objects (20.9%). Traumatic agents were blunt and sharp in 56% and 17% of cases, respectively. Majority of traumatic agents were solid (82.1%). Seven percent of victims were drowsy during trauma and 98.4% of participants were not using any protective device at the time of injury. In 60.7% of cases, time elapsed between injury and treatment was between 1 and 24 h. Around 44.5% had isolated ocular trauma and rest 55.5% were polytrauma cases. Three hundred and sixty-eight (91.5%) participants had unilateral involvement and 8.5% had bilateral involvement. Almost 52.8% had injuries of adnexa and 32.8% had globe injuries. More than half of the study participants had ≥3 ocular structure involvement. After 6 months, 14.8% of the right eyes and 25.5% of the left eyes showed poor outcome. <br><br>CONCLUSION: This study highlights epidemiology of ocular trauma in northern India. Mass health education and awareness about risk of ocular trauma, morbidity caused by delayed presentation, and need to adopt safety or preventive strategies should be focused, especially during travel, playground, and at workplace.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Mixed-flow intersections are prevailing in many developing countries such as China and India. At mixed-flow intersections, there is no clear lane discipline or regular trajectories within the intersection, especially for the non-motorized traffic. This leads to more interactions and encounters between the motorized traffic and the non-motorized traffic. Hence, critical instantaneous decision events such as abrupt accelerating, decelerating, jerking, swerving, and swinging, may occur more frequently, which result in potential traffic conflicts and crashes. This study presents a methodology to identify critical instantaneous decision events at the mixed-flow signalized intersections, based on the entropy theory and high-resolution vehicle trajectory data. A three-dimensional cube searching algorithm is firstly proposed to extract general traffic events by examining the proximity between trajectories. A novel model incorporating vehicle kinematics and Permutation Entropy is then developed to identify critical events, by quantifying driving volatility based on the time-serial trajectory data. Next, 3, 349 vehicle trajectories and 805 bicycle trajectories with a resolution of 0.12 s collected at a signalized intersection in Shanghai are used to demonstrate the proposed method. <br><br>RESULTS show that the proposed method is capable of identifying critical instantaneous decision events, and tends to produce a higher identification ratio comparing with the conventional method solely based on kinematic thresholds. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the effects of model parameters on the performance of the proposed method. The presented work could be applied for traffic safety assessment, real-time driving alert systems, and early diagnosis of risk-prone road users at mixed-flow intersections.<br><br>Copyright © 2018.

N2  - Tunnels have become indispensable in modern road networks in hilly regions. Lighting and ventilation plays a vital role in efficient traffic management inside the tunnel. With rapid strides in lighting instruments and luminaires and with the advent of LEDs, the scope of lighting inside tunnel has become very interesting. In most of the modern day tunnels, LEDs are being preferred over High Pressure Sodium (HPS). However adaptation to new technology is slow in many countries due to high upfront costs of these luminaires. Besides absence of enabling codal provisions also sometimes plays spoiler. CIE - 88 do cater to photometric needs of the lighting arrangement inside tunnel, but stops short of exclusively providing for LEDs. It has been established in many studies that life cycle cost of LEDs and their photometric efficiency make for a strong case for adoption of LED as preferred luminaires for tunnel lighting. Theng tunnel in North Sikkim has adopted LED lighting arrangement in keeping with the modern trends and to bring down energy needs. The provisions of the contract agreement has been amended to make adoption of this new material/practice possible. LED should be used in all future tunnels and highway lighting in view of significant saving in energy cost and low life cycle cost.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Drowning is a major but often neglected public health problem. After road traffic accidents, one of the leading causes of death from inadvertent injuries is Drowning. Drowning accounts for 7.4 percent of all unnatural deaths in India. About one by fourth of these deaths are happening in the swimming pools. Providing proper aid at the proper time is vital to save victims from serious injuries. In this paper, we are investigating a robot system with an overhead gantry that will quickly respond to this kind of situations by dropping ring buoy at the marked coordinates. A settled Overhead camera which is enabled with a legitimate drowning detection algorithm recognize the drowning incidents and sends the position coordinates to the gantry robot. Kinematics of the devised gantry robot system is studied and simulation is carried out in MATLAB.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Objectives Homeless and unclaimed dead bodies are a social as well as legal stigma on a country's development index. In addition, homeless people are exposed to increased incidence of diseases, accidents and mortality. Lucknow city, a city situated in the heart of the great Gangetic plain in the northern region of India, is surrounded by rural towns and villages and has seen tremendous growth in the past few years; with this the problem of migrants and homelessness has also increased. This has resulted in a spectrum of problems relating to law and order, including frequent incidences of unclaimed dead bodies, both due to natural and unnatural causes. Few studies on this subject have been published in India.     Study design Observational retrospective study.    Methods Data were collected from the files of the Department of Forensic Medicine & Toxicology between 2008 and 2012.    Results A total of 20877 autopsy cases were registered, out of which 3169 (15.17%) were unclaimed bodies. The majority of cases belonged to males (2218, 69.99%) as compared to females (951, 30.01%). Most unclaimed bodies were in the age group of 41-60 years (47.24%) and the least affected age group was 1-20 years (265, 8.36%). The most common manner of death was accident (1098, 34.64%), followed by suicide (1062, 33.51%), natural (927, 29.25%) and homicides (82, 2.59%). The most common cause of natural death in both males and females was chronic lung disease. Railway and road traffic accidents accounted for 516 (68.25%) accidental deaths in males, whereas in females they accounted for 301(88.01%). The most common mode of suicide among males was by poisoning (391, 48.81%), while poisoning (149, 57.08), hanging (78, 29.88%) and drowning (23, 8.81%) were the main modes of suicide in females reported in our study. Majority of the cases of deaths were reported during rainy season (2209, 69.70%).    Conclusions This autopsy-based study tries to highlight the situation of picture of homeless deaths in Lucknow and the problems faced by the law enforcing authorities. More research is needed to identify the health-related problems of such people and possible contributory factors to mortality.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Safety 2010 World Injury Conference, London, Abstract:       Background: Studies have suggested considerable injury mortality in India, a large proportion of these is due to unintentional injuries. However no reliable data are available to provide national estimates for these deaths.    Objective: To determine the mortality burden of unintentional injuries at a national level.    Methods: We analysed unintentional injury data from the Sample Registration System - Million death study from 2001 to 2003, using verbal autopsy method, in a nationally representative sample of over 125 000 deaths among 1.1 million homes.    Findings: Unintentional injuries (ICD-10 codes for Chapter XX) were identified and contributed 7% to all cause mortality. Proportionate mortality was highest in the age group of 70+ years, with more than 60% injury deaths due to falls, although there is also greater misclassification of causes at older ages. The highest proportions of drowning deaths were in under 5 years (14%), the highest proportion of road traffics deaths were in the age group of 30-39 years (10%) of all unintentional deaths. Proportionate mortality due to unintentional injury in males (8%) was higher than in females (5%). Overall there was no difference in rural urban proportionate mortality, though type of injury leading to deaths differed. Road traffic injuries (29%), falls (26%) and drowning (11%) were the leading causes of injury mortality.    Interpretation: Unintentional injury burden in India is substantial. There is need for continued monitoring of injury mortality and understanding of specific risk factors for development of effective injury prevention programs.<p />

N2  - Background Unintentional injuries are an important cause of death in India. However, no reliable nationally representative estimates of unintentional injury deaths are available.    Aim To estimate total unintentional injury mortality in India using results from a nationally representative survey of the causes of deaths.    Methods Unintentional injury deaths were examined in a nationally representative mortality survey covering 123 000 deaths occurring in 1.1 million homes. Trained non-medical field staff to interview all households in which a death had occurred from 2001 to 2003 within its Sample Registration System. Structured field reports detailing the events preceding death were obtained from living relatives of the deceased and emailed to two of 130 trained physicians who independently assigned an underlying cause to each death. Cause specific mortality proportions were applied to all-cause mortality estimates from the United Nations for the year 2005.    Results In the year 2005, unintentional injury caused 648 000 deaths (7% of all deaths; 58/100 000 population). Mortality rates were higher among males than females, and in rural versus urban areas. Road traffic injuries (185 000 deaths; 29% of unintentional injury deaths), falls (160 000 deaths, 25%) and drowning (73 000 deaths, 11%) were the three leading causes of unintentional injury mortality. The highest unintentional mortality rates were in those aged 70 years or older (410/100 000) mostly due to falls.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In India, half of the annual 200,000 road traffic deaths occur in hospitals, but the exact in-hospital trauma mortality rate remains unknown. A research consortium of universities, with a mandate to reduce trauma mortality, measured the baseline 30-day in-hospital mortality rate. <br><br>METHODS: Between September 2013 and February 2015, trained data collectors collected on-admission demographic, physiological vital signs, and health service performance indicators (time of injury to admission, investigation, or intervention) on all patients with traumatic injuries admitted to four public university hospitals in three Indian megacities. <br><br>RESULTS: Of the 11,202 hospitalized trauma patients, 21.4 % died within 30 days of hospitalization. The median age was 30 years for survivors and 37 years for non-survivors. The on-admission systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score was near-normal in survivors, but was significantly lower in non-survivors and associated with both early and late mortality (p = 0.001). In the absence of a trauma system, there were process-of-care delays from injury to reaching and being examined, investigated, or operated in the hospital. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Using a multi-institutional Indian registry, this study is the first to systematically document that the 30-day in-hospital trauma mortality was twice that found in similar registries from high-income countries. Physiological scoring of on-admission vitals was clinically useful to predict mortality. More research is needed to understand the causes of high mortality and time delays in the process of delivering trauma care in India, which has no prehospital or trauma system.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of maxillofacial injuries is on the rise due to motor vehicle accidents and increased incidence of violence in recent times. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and the pattern of fractures in the maxillofacial region. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining permission from the concerned authorities, a predesigned questionnaire was used to collect the necessary data from the department. A retrospective analysis of 787 patients, who suffered trauma and were managed in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Indira Gandhi Government Dental College (IGGDC), Jammu over a period of 2 years was carried out. <br><br>RESULTS: Road traffic accident (RTA) was the common cause of maxillofacial injuries. Men sustained more injuries as compared to women. Injuries were most commonly sustained in the age group of 11-40 years, constituting about 76% of all injuries, mandibular fractures were the most common. <br><br>CONCLUSION: RTAs were the commonest cause for the maxillofacial injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a major cause of misery, disability and death globally, with a disproportionate number occurring in developing countries. Complications from closed head injuries are the single largest cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who reach the hospital alive. The present study assesses the outcome in the management of head injury admitted in our hospital following RTA in the period of one year.  Methods: This retrospective study carried out in the department of Neurosurgery in a rural tertiary hospital, Kolar, Karnataka, India. Patients who got admitted between periods of January 2012 to January 2013 were included in the study. All patients were clinically evaluated by a team comprising of doctors from surgical, medical and orthopedics specialties in the emergency department and subsequently admitted and treated at neurosurgery. The study was conducted based on these reports and observations and outcome of patients. The results were expressed as percentages.<br><br>RESULTS: At the time of admission 41% patients were under alcoholic influence, 97% patients had history of LOC, 50% patients had ENT bleed and 7.5% had CSF leak.  The GCS score of less than 8 was seen in 33% cases, 9 to12 in 52% cases and between 12 to 14 in 15% patients. As per Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), 91% of patients had good recovery, 5.5% patients had disability (hemiparesis, ptosis) and 3.5% patients died in the course of treatment. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Head injury due to RTA is a recognized major public health problem causing death and disability among the population. So it should be managed in time and also should be looked seriously by concerned authority for reducing the incidences of head injury associated with RTA and protecting people by debilitating conditions.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background Studies from high income countries suggest improved survival for females as compared to males following trauma. However, data regarding differences in trauma outcomes between females and males is severely lacking from low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to determine the association between sex and clinical outcomes amongst Indian trauma patients using the Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration database. <br><br>METHODS A prospective multicentre cohort study was performed across four urban public hospitals in India April 2016 through February 2018. Bivariate analyses compared admission physiological parameters and mechanism of injury. Logistic regression assessed association of sex with the primary outcomes of 30-day and 24-hour in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, ICU length of stay, ventilator requirement, and time on a ventilator. <br><br>RESULTS Of 8,605 patients, 1,574 (18.3%) were females. The most common mechanism of injury was falls for females (52.0%) and road traffic injury for males (49.5%). On unadjusted analysis, there was no difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality between females (11.6%) and males (12.6%, p = 0.323). However, females demonstrated a lower mortality at 24-hours (1.1% vs males 2.1%, p = 0.011) on unadjusted analysis. Females were also less likely to require a ventilator (17.3% vs 21.0% males, p = 0.001) or ICU admission (34.4% vs 37.5%, p = 0.028). Stratification by age or by ISS demonstrated no difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality for males vs females across age and ISS categories. On multivariable regression analysis, sex was not associated significantly with 30-day or 24-hour in-hospital mortality. <br><br>CONCLUSION This study did not demonstrate a significant difference in the 30-day trauma mortality or 24-hour trauma mortality between female and male trauma patients in India on adjusted analyses. A more granular data is needed to understand the interplay of injury severity, immediate post-traumatic hormonal and immunological alterations, and the impact of gender-based disparities in acute care settings.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, D.A.V [C] Dental College and Hospital, Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, India conducted a study on patients with maxillofacial fractures in a time span of seven years (2003-2010). The purpose of this study was to evaluate their aetiology, incidence, patterns and different modalities employed for management. METHODS: In this study, 740 patients with 1054 fractures were evaluated clinically and radiographically, based on which closed reduction and open reduction was undertaken. Review of patient records included: Age, sex, time, mechanism and etiology of injury, history of bleeding, unconsciousness and prior first aid, type of vehicle and use of preventive measures, type of fracture and treatment modalities. RESULTS: Road traffic accidents accounted for highest number of fractures predominantly occurring in the age group of 21-30 years (38.3%)1,2. Males incurred more fractures with a male female ratio of 4.2: 1.Mandible was the most commonly fractured bone with parasymphysis being the commonest affected site.76.66% patients had associated head injury and 15.68 % had history of unconsciousness. Open reduction and internal fixation was the preferred modality for mandible whereas the mid face fractures were treated more often by closed methods. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries occurred more commonly in 20 - 40 age range with road traffic accident being the major etiological factor. Majority of the patients were driving two wheelers and most were under the effect of alcohol. Most of the injuries occurred during night and road traffic accidents (71.89%) were found to be the major etiological factor. Out of 532 road traffic accidents, 490 patients (66.2%) were on two wheelers, among whom 49(10%) were wearing helmet. In the mandible, fractures occurred most commonly in the parasymphyseal region (224, 30.2%), and out of the 314 fractures of the middle third showed, 155 (49.4%) ZMC. OPG was the most commonly advised Xray. With regard to treatment modalities, 36.8% of all the mandibular fractures (740) were treated by closed reduction, 62.6% were treated using open reduction and 0.5% was under observation only.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: India is facing the dual problem of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Among NCD; injuries is a major public health problem resulting in major socio-economic impact and data regarding this is inadequate. Hence present study was undertaken with an objective to study the patterns of injuries and its socio-economic impact on individual and the family in an urban area.     Methods: Cross sectional study was conducted covering 3003 population by house-house survey. Pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire was used. Among injured further injury details was obtained.     Results: Prevalence of injuries was 4.93% (95% CI 4.1 to 5.7). Median (IQR) age of injured was 25.5 (12.25-40.75) years. Injuries among 15-59 years were 65.3% and among males were high 66.9%. Based upon external cause, falls was the commonest. Lower limb was common injury site and 46.6% were of severe injuries. Median number of working days lost by injured and by care giver and number of days taken by the injured person to return back to routine activities differed significantly between moderate and severely injured persons. Average amount of direct and indirect expenditure per injury was Rs. 14826 and Rs. 16737 respectively.     Conclusions: Injury prevalence was 4.93%; Commonest type of injuries was falls and road traffic injuries. More severe the injury; higher was the socio-economic impact.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background; Trauma secondary to road traffic accidents is a pandemic in India for various reasons. However data on trauma, it's burden on healthcare and specifically on Intensive care is scarce. Thus from a clinical, epidemiology and health care perspective we intended to verify the burden of trauma in a tertiary level ICU. In a single centre concurrent cohort study, our objective was to verify the morbidity and mortality of patients admitted to the ICU following road traffic collisions.<br><br>METHODS: Patients admitted with polytrauma following road traffic collisions over a 10 month  period were included. Baseline characteristics including vehicles involved, site of injury, acuity scores were recorded. Primary outcomes measured were days in ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes planned were, number of days in ICU, Hospital stay and ventilator free days, prevalence of rhabdomyolysis (defined by the authors as creatine kinase level above > 500), a clinical diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome, and acute renal failure.<br><br>RESULTS:Trauma related to road traffic accidents accounted for 15% of all admissions. 84.4% were male and average age was 35.4. Commonest vehicles implicated were two wheelers and commonest injuries were to extremities and abdomen. Mortality was 21.9% and average ICU stay was 4 days, hospital stay was 12 days. Injury Severity score was most predictive of mortality.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Trauma related to road traffic collisions results in a significant burden to the ICU (and the individual) and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. ISS is predictive of mortality. Preventive measures, training and resources need to be improved to deal with the burden of trauma, and the mortality and morbidity associated with it.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Objectives: This study aims to provide a five-year retrospective statistical analysis of maxillofacial injuries in patients admitted and treated during 1 st January 1998 and 31 st December 2002 in two hospitals of Mysore city; to determine the age and sex distribution, etiology, type of injury, day and time of accident, and the influence of alcohol and other drugs; andto suggest measures to prevent such injuries. Materials and Methods: After obtaining permission from the concerned authorities, a pre-designed questionnaire was used to collect the necessary data from the two hospitals. The data was then computerized and statistical analysis was done using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) windows version 10. Results: Road traffic accident (RTA) was the common cause for maxillofacial injuries. Men sustained more injuries compared to women. The injuries were mostly sustained in the age group of 11-40 years, constituting about 78% of all the injuries. Two wheelers were the most commonly involved compared to other vehicle types. Influence of alcohol at the time of injury was found in about 58% of the patients with maxillofacial injuries. The most number of accidents occurred in the weekends. Mandibular fractures were the most common. Conclusion: RTAs are the most common cause for maxillofacial injuries. If RTAs are considered an epidemic of modern times, then prevention is its vaccine.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion (Safety 2022)    Background The cause of death in any injury can only be determined with reasonable accuracy after a post-mortem. Evaluation of post-mortem results give us an understanding of the injury patterns that could lead to death.     Method We used one year data of a public post-mortem facility (mortuary) in Delhi, India. The data included all unnatural deaths whose post-mortem were conducted by a single forensic pathologist. The mortuary is close to an at-grade railway crossing with squatter settlement on either side. In India, ordinarily, post-mortems are done only in medico-legal cases, where deaths have occurred from injury, poisoning, suicide, or homicide. All homicide cases were excluded from the analysis. We assessed the region injured and the nature of injury for 140 cases.     Results There were 11 suicide cases with an average age of 26 years, 23 road traffic crashes, and 33 cases of pedestrians hit by trains on railway tracks. Visceral toxic investigation details were not available for any of the cases. Most deaths due to traffic crashes were severe head injuries with few truncal and abdominal injuries.     Conclusion Railways are considered a safe mode of transport and pedestrian deaths at railway tracks are not treated as rail related in India, leading to misclassification of such deaths. A large proportion of road traffic deaths were hit-and-run, however, injury patterns can be used to infer the striking mode of transport.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Reliable epidemiological information on injury burden and pattern is essential to formulate effective injury control and prevention strategies. Injury surveillance systems are globally gaining ground as a tool for collecting such systematic data on injuries, but less so in low and middle income countries. This study describes the experience of setting up a District Level Hospital-Based Injury Surveillance System in India and the pattern of injuries encountered therein. <br><br>METHODS: A prospective study was conducted during Jan-Dec 2012 at the emergency department of a District Hospital in Fatehgarh Sahib in a North Indian state of Punjab. A comprehensive injury proforma was devised to record information on all injury cases reporting to the hospital. Emergency Medical Officers were trained to record data. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 649 injuries were reported in 2012. The surveilance system used the existing resources at the hospital to collect data without the need for additional manpower, equipments etc. About 78 % of injuries reported were unintentional in nature. More than half (52.9 %) of the patients had injuries due to Road Traffic Crashes. Head (29.7 %) was the most common site of injury. Incised injury (50.2 %) was the most common type of injury and most of the injuries occurred while travelling (61.8 %). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Developing better and sustainable systems of routine injury surveillance or trauma registries is essential to generate reliable information for formulating effective intervention policies.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury continues to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). The World Health Organization has called for a strengthening of prehospital care in order to improve outcomes from trauma. In this study we sought to profile traumatic injury seen in the prehospital setting in India and identify predictors of mortality in this patient population. <br><br>METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of a convenience sample of patients using a single emergency medical services (EMS) system for traumatic injuries across seven states in India from November 2015 through January 2016. Any patient with a chief complaints indicative of a traumatic injury was eligible for enrollment. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality. <br><br>RESULTS: We enrolled 2905 patients. Follow-up rates were 76% at 2 days, 70% at 7 days, and 70% at 30 days. The median age was 36 years (IQR: 25-50) and were predominately male (72%, N = 2088), of lower economic status (97%, N = 2805 used a government issued ration card) and were from rural or tribal areas (74%, N = 2162). Cumulative mortality at 2, 7, and 30 days, was 3%, 4%, and 4% respectively. Predictors of 30-day mortality were prehospital abnormal mental status (OR 7.5 (95% CI: 4-14)), presence of hypoxia or hypotension (OR 4.0 (95% CI: 2.2-7)), on-scene mobility (OR 2.8 (95% CI: 1.3-6)), and multisystem injury inclusive of head injury (OR 2.3 (95% CI: 1.1-5)). <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: EMS in an LMIC can transport trauma patients from poor and rural areas that traditionally struggle to access timely trauma care to facilities in a timeframe consistent with current international recommendations. Information readily obtained by EMTs predicts 30-day mortality within this population and could be utilized for triaging patients with the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality.<br><br>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: This retrospective observational study was done in the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary care trauma center in Southern India in 2018 (January to December). <br><br>RESULTS: During the study period of 1 year, the ED attended 74,466 patients which included 7675 (10.3%) trauma patients. The mean age was 35.3 (SD: 18.5) years with three-fourth (76.6%) being males. Pediatric/adolescents (age ≤18 years) and geriatric age groups (age ≥60 years) comprised 16.7% and 11.8% cases, respectively. Road traffic accidents (RTA) (66%) were the predominant mode of injury followed by falls (fall from height: 8.6% and fall on level ground: 7.8%). Among the RTAs, the majority were two-wheelers related (73.8%), followed by pedestrian injuries (9.4%) and four-wheelers injuries (7.2%). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed pedestrian injuries, low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and hypotension at arrival as independent predictors of hospital mortality. The in-hospital mortality rate was 0.7%. A quarter (24%; n = 1841) of the patient's population was solely managed by the ED team and discharged stable, while 2179 (28.4%) victims required hospital admission. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Trauma is a major cause of mortality especially among the breadwinners of families in India with almost half being due to two-wheeler accidents. Efficient ED professionals and a multispecialty team of trauma surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopedics handle the major load of acute trauma. Pedestrian injuries, low GCS, and hypotension at arrival are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - PURPOSE: Trauma accounts for the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in the present day and may rightly be called the new pandemic. The prominent nature of the face exposes it to various traumatic injuries. A timely, prompt diagnosis along with employment of correct and quick treatment greatly improves the outcome for these patients. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the characteristics of maxillofacial injuries over a decade. <br><br>METHODS: The data were collected manually from the medical records of patients who reported to the tertiary centre from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019. All injured patients irrespective of age/gender with complete hospital records of clinical and radiographical diagnosis of maxillofacial injuries were included. The demographic data, etiology, site and type of injury, and seasonal variation were analyzed. Data were tabulated into six age groups (0-7 years, 8-18 years, 19-35 years, 36-40 years, 41-59 years, and >60 years). Five etiological factors, i.e. road traffic accidents, falls, assaults, sports-related, and occupational accidents, were further evaluated based on genders. Facial injuries were classified into six types: panfacial fractures, mandibular fractures (subcategorized), midface fractures (subcategorized), dentoalveolar fractures, dental injuries, and soft tissue injuries. The monthly and seasonal variation of the injuries was also charted. Data were expressed as frequency and percent. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 10,703 injuries were included from the tertiary centre from the period of 2011-2019, including 8637 males and 2066 females, with the highest occurrence of the injuries between 19 and 35 years. Road traffic accident was the principal etiological factor of the maxillofacial injuries in both genders (80.5%). This was followed by falls (9.6%), assaults (8.0%), occupational accidents (1.2%), and sporting injuries (0.7%). Midface fractures amounted for 52.5% (5623 fractures), followed by mandibular fractures (38.1%). <br><br>CONCLUSION: The current study describes a change in the incidence of injuries along with variation in the demographic data. The implementation of safety gears and stricter traffic laws along with public awareness may aid in the reduction of maxillofacial injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of road traffic accidents (RTA) is increasing every day, especially in developing nations. Amongst various attributable factors, the menace of the stray animals remains one of the most underrecognized factors leading to animal-vehicle collision (AVC). <br><br>OBJECTIVES: Our prospective cross-sectional study aims to survey the incidence of RTA attributable to stray animals and record the pattern of injuries along with other epidemiological parameters. <br><br>METHODS: The present study was conducted at a tertiary care trauma centre located in a major city of eastern India, between June 2019 and March 2020. Variables like demographic details, type of vehicle and injury with severity score, use of safety gear including types of stray animals were collected and analysed. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 185 patients had suffered RTA due to AVC during the study period. The median age of occurrence was 29.0 years. The evening was the most frequent time of accidents (4 PM to 8 PM) with two-wheelers affected in 92% of cases. Stray dogs account for 69% of cases followed by cattle 21% cases. 41% of all RTA victims had polytrauma. Patients with RTA due to impact with ox were found to have higher injury severity score (ISS). The ISS comparison between two-wheeler drivers with and without helmet and influence of alcohol were statistically significant (P<0.01). <br><br>CONCLUSION: The study highlights an alarming incidence of RTA due to stray animals roaming freely on roads, thus adding significant morbidity and costs to the society. There is a need of the hour for imposing stringent measures from the appropriate authority, including public awareness to make sustainable action plans to prevent animal homelessness and wander freely on streets and major roads.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally, with an impact similar to that caused by many communicable diseases, such as malaria. road traffic injuries are estimated to cost low- and middle-income countries between 1-2 % of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), an estimate of about US$ 100 billion a year. <br><br>OBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiological profile of Road Traffic Injuries among the patients admitted in a tertiary care centre and too find out the various out of pocket expenditure in the patients of Road Traffic Accidents. Material and Method: The present study was a hospital based Descriptive Prospective Study. A list of all the patients admitted due to Road Traffic Accident in last one week was obtained from the ward sisters of Orthopedic Department. All the selected participants were interviewed on the two fixed days. A pre tested structured open ended questionnaire was used for data collection. <br><br>RESULTS: Of the 48 participants interviewed, 34male and 14 females. Most common age group affected was 21-25 years followed by 16-20 years. The rate of accidents was most common on the weekends. The rate of accidents was more in  users of two wheelers. Majority of the expenditure in the First week of admission was on the purchase of medicines followed by diagnosis. Majority of the victims also suffered huge financial loss due to loss of salary, closure of shop, loss due to daily wages etc. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The present study hereby concludes that there is an urgent need for creating awareness about Road Traffic Accident. The study also concludes that majority of the out of pocket expenditure in the first week of admission is on the medication.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Expansion in road network, motorization, and urbanization in the country has been accompanied by a rise in road accidents leading to road traffic injuries (RTIs). Today RTIs are one of the leading causes of deaths, disabilities, and hospitalizations with severe socioeconomic costs across the world.   Methods: It is a retrospective record-based study of patient attending the causality of S.G.M.H. Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, India last one year, after road traffic accident. Study area was tertiary care hospital S.G.M.H. Rewa Madhya Pradesh, India. Simple random sampling method are used among all RTA victims visit to causality of S.G.M.H. Rewa. Study period was 1 year from st January 2015 to 3st December 2015. Sample size was 325 RTA and 412 victims. Main objective of the study was to determine sociodemographic factors and their circumstances leading to RTA, outcome and seasonal variations of RTA. Study variables were demographic, human, vehicular, environmental and time factors and statistical analysis, percentages, linear and logarithmic trend and chi-square.   Results: 325 RTA was occurred in the year 2015 in which injured person were 412 who visited to causality of S.G.M.H Rewa in whom 298 (72.33%) were males and 114 (27.66%) were females, and most 49.02% of them belong to 21-40 year age. Alcohol consumption was found in 20.61% but fatality was high (76.11%) and high speed of the vehicle was the causing factor in 71.38% and case fatality was also high (73.94%) in high speed RTA. More number of RTA occurred at unfamiliar road ratio between RTA occurred at unfamiliar road and familiar road was 2.73:1 and fatality was also high in unfamiliar road accident.   Conclusions: Most of the factors responsible for RTA and its fatal consequences are preventable. A comprehensive multipronged approach can mitigate most of them.

N2  - Trauma is a global challenge and India has one of the highest trauma deaths in the world. Despite United Nations target to halve the global number of deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes by 2030, death tolls from Road Traffic Injuries (RTI) rising in India. In pediatric age groups, falls from height add to the burden of trauma. Uncontrolled bleeding from exsanguination on scene is estimated to account for nearly 40% of RTI trauma related mortality. Stopping the bleeding in the first few minutes is crucial for meaningful survival and hence the role of training lay public who can reach the scene in minutes. Active Bleeding Control (ABC) pilot research project to simulation train the bystanders to stop the bleed showed promising outcomes in Hyderabad, India. This paper describes the ABC project and discusses the role of pediatricians in training the public to reduce morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled bleeding at trauma scene.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Emergencies such as road traffic accidents (RTAs), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are the most common causes of death and disability in India. Robust emergency medicine (EM) services and proper education on acute care are necessary. In order to inform curriculum design for training programs, and to improve the quality of EM care in India, a better understanding of patient epidemiology and case burden presenting to the emergency department (ED) is needed. <br><br>METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review of cases presenting to the ED at Kerala Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), a private hospital in Trivandrum, Kerala, India, from November 1, 2011 to April 21, 2012 and from July 1, 2013 to December 21, 2013. De-identified charts were systematically sampled and reviewed. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 1 196 ED patient charts were analyzed. Of these patients, 55.35% (n=662) were male and 44.7% (n=534) were female. The majority (67.14%, n=803) were adults, while only 3.85% (n=46) were infants. The most common chief complaints were fever (21.5%, n=257), renal colic (7.3%, n=87), and dyspnea (6.9%, n=82). The most common ED diagnoses were gastrointestinal (15.5%, n=185), pulmonary (12.3%, n=147), tropical (11.1%, n=133), infectious disease and sepsis (9.9%, n=118), and trauma (8.4%, n=101). <br><br>CONCLUSION: The patient demographics, diagnoses, and distribution of resources identified by this study can help guide and shape Indian EM training programs and faculty development to more accurately reflect the burden of acute disease in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>
