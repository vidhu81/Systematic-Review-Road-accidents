N2  - BACKGROUND: Adolescents (10-19 years old) comprise a fifth of the Indian population (253.2 million), yet there is very little published information about the burden of disease and injury for this age group. This paper aims to provide a contemporary picture of the leading causes of death and disability for Indian adolescent girls and boys for 2013, and changes in deaths and disability between 1990 and 2013. <br><br>METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for India, for the years 1990 and 2013, were accessed. Data were categorized into two age groups: 10 to 14 years (younger adolescents) and 15 to 19 years (older adolescents) and analysed separately for girls and boys. <br><br>RESULTS: The study shows that for both younger and older adolescent boys and for older adolescent girls, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries are responsible for a greater number of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) than communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are still important causes of death and disability for young adolescents. Among older adolescents there is an increasing burden of death and disability due to self-harm, road traffic injuries, fire- and heat-related injuries and mental disorders such as depressive disorders. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Although strategies to reduce the burden of communicable diseases among adolescents must continue to be an important focus, innovative, evidence-based strategies aimed at reducing the growing burden of NCDs and injuries must be elevated as a priority.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: As per WHO, nearly 1.33 million people die every year due to road traffic accidents (RTAs) all over the world. 10% of the annual average of road traffic accidents cases occurs in India. Aims and Objective: To determine the knowledge, attitude and practices related to road safety rules among college students. <br><br>METHODology: A descriptive cross‑sectional study was conducted on 102 college students through a pre‑tested questionnaire. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version‑23) software, Chicago, USA, was used for data analysis. <br><br>RESULTS: 91.3% of the college students knew the right age for getting a driving license but only 24.5% students responded correctly for the blood alcohol concentration while driving. Most of the study participants had good attitude towards road traffic rules and regulations, driving license, road signs & symbols. 63‑65% of the study participants responded that they always wear belt or helmet while driving and keep a specific speed limit while driving, and never used mobile phone or play loud music while driving. <br><br>CONCLUSION: RTAs can be minimized by strict enforcement of regulations by the road traffic police and through frequent road traffic awareness. But the self‑responsibility by the drivers should also be there to bring about drastic change in minimizing RTAs.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road crash injuries have emerged as a significant public health issue in many low and middle-income countries in recent years. In India, motorized two-wheelers comprise 70% of the vehicle population and are considered the most vulnerable road users. Road crash injury is common among the young-aged population leading to premature deaths. It is essential to understand risky riding behaviors to develop accurate, evidence-based risk reduction programmes that fit the target population's characteristics and the intervention setting. The current study aims to improve the understanding of the typical characteristics of motorcycle crashes among young riders in India, primarily focusing on the prevalence and role of risky riding behaviors. Five focus group discussions with eight to ten participants in each group (N = 35) were conducted in Manipal, in the Karnataka state of Southwestern India. A thematic analysis was completed using MAXQDA software to identify, analyze, and report on themes within the data. Speeding, riding under the influence of alcohol, and the poor maintenance of motorcycles were indicated as leading causes of crashes. Furthermore, using mobile phones while riding, violations of the traffic rules, and helmet non-use were identified as other risky behaviors among young riders. Future research can be taken up in other settings for the target population. Generational awareness with the involvement of young riders, government authorities, university officials, and the Regional Transport Office can be initiated. Engaging young riders, government authorities, university officials, and the Regional Transport Office through behavioral interventions such as persuasive communication techniques, an active experimental approach (such as the use of a simulator), and regulating the licensing procedure can reduce the number of road crashes.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - According to World Health Organization, road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.24 million deaths worldwide in the year 2010, down from 1.26 million in 2000. In the South East Asian region of the WHO, India alone accounted for 73% of RTA burden. The younger generation in particular is not willing to wear the helmets or seat belts while riding in two wheelers or four wheelers. The aim of this study is to assess the basic road safety knowledge and practices among the youth in an Arts college in Vijayawada city. It is a cross sectional study conducted on 260 PB Siddhartha Arts College students in November 2013. Participants were selected using convenience sampling and data is collected using semi structured questionnaire. Data entered and analysed using MS Office 2007.

N2  - Background Road traffic injuries are the commonest and second leading cause of death in the 15-19 and 5-14 years age group, respectively.    Aim Road safety of school children is a poorly addressed issue in India. Safety features near schools and awareness among students were assessed in schools in Vellore.    Methodology A school transport safety checklist was prepared based on robust recommendations. A questionnaire was administered to 146 Year nine students, aged 13-17 years. Six schools were selected by convenience sampling.    Results None of the schools had speed breakers, traffic redistribution arrangements, pedestrian crossings or median islands. 66.67% had no school zone board or traffic lights at intersections near the school. Eighty-seven of 146 questionnaire respondents were boys. About 22-25% of students reported having either collided with, or been involved in a crash with a two-wheeler in the previous month. A total of 49% of the two-wheeler users rode motorised vehicles to school, despite being under-age for licence. None of the cyclists wore helmets. Only 16% students could not identify even one of four common road signs.    Significance Findings revealed near non-existent safety features near schools and inadequate awareness regarding road safety among students. A phased school safety plan should be planned in consultation with civil authorities. These findings could represent the situation in other parts of India.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic accident's (RTA's) is an important global public health problem causing 20 to 50 million non-fatal injuries and 1.25 million deaths annually, currently the 8th leading cause of death globally and predicted to become the 5th leading cause of death by 2030. RTA is one of the leading cause of death among the most productive age group (15-29 years) costing billions of dollars to deal with its consequences. The present study is aimed to determine the awareness and behavioral patterns about road safety measures among undergraduate medical students, Bangalore.<br><br>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 540 undergraduate medical students in a medical college, Bangalore from August to October, 2015 by universal sampling technique using a semi-structured, pre-tested questionnaire.<br><br>RESULTS: Majority of the study participants were aware of traffic signal rules 99.2% and helmets usage 98.8%. 87.7% knew that alcohol consumption is dangerous while driving/riding, 67% were aware of seat belts usage and only 64.8% were aware of usage of hands free devices while driving/riding. Among the 392 two wheeler and 188 four wheeler users, 36.2% and 50% regularly used helmets/seatbelts respectively and 70% followed lane rule. The risky behaviours like jumping traffic signals, riding hands free, drag racing and drunken driving were noted.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS: In order to restrict the epidemic of RTA's undertaking proper road safety measures are the best available interventions. The overall knowledge and practice of road safety measures was high except in certain areas the practice levels were not desirable which has to be strengthened.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - India is one of the fastest emerging and young nation that unfortunately ranks at the top with the highest number of fatalities due to road accidents that contributes 11% share in the world. Nonetheless, there are only a few studies that have been carried out for understanding the Indian adolescent road user behavioural effects on traffic safety. Thus, this study explores the adolescent road-user behaviour for urban India by exercising a questionnaire survey among adolescents (N = 1,015) at Patna, India to comprehend road safety behavioural characteristics. The behavioural questionnaire comprises of 40 items of adolescent road user in the age group of 13 to 17-year-old to analyse the parameter which influences the injuries and fatalities for this age group. These adolescents have been evaluated based on their rapid physical, psychological, cognitive and social development involving in unsafe riding behaviour, rash riding, speeding on the open road and dangerous thought patterns. The Adolescent Road User Behaviour Questionnaire (ARUBQ) completed along with the interaction effects of age, gender, qualification, religion, etc. on a 5-point Likert scale. The principal axis factor analysis using varimax rotation has been performed to a response of 40 items which were best fitted and revised to 27 items that have good internal confidence reliability. The three variables factors: "unsafe road crossing behaviour", "dangerous playing on the road", and "planned protective behaviour" solutions were identified based on a study of adolescent road-user behaviour. The effects of demographic variables on ARUBQ scale's score were obtained for each behavioural item. This study in the context of emerging urban India ascertains and provide a tool for future study in the enforcement of traffic rule and regulation that can play an important role in developing road-user safety for adolescents in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - CONTEXT: Drowning is a major, but often neglected, public health problem. Drowning is the second leading cause of death from unintentional injuries, after road traffic injuries. According to the World Health Organization, 0.7% of all deaths worldwide (>500,000 deaths) each year are due to unintentional drowning. In India, very little is known about the epidemiology of drowning. There is almost no awareness or protocols to prevent drowning. <br><br>OBJECTIVES: The objective is to study the prevalence, risk factors, and types of drowning among school children in the Malabar region. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based study by semistructured interview method was performed among 8433 school children of 5-15 years. STATISTICAL METHODS: The prevalence of drowning was calculated. Odds ratio was calculated and represented under 95% confidence interval. Risk factors were analyzed as frequency with percentage. <br><br>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The total study population was 8433 students, comprising 4795 boys (56.86%) and 3638 (43.13%) girls. A total of 342 (4.06%) students had a history of drowning. These survivors were further interviewed. The prevalence of drowning was much higher compared to figures reported in literature. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the general perception, drowning is a common occurrence among children. Swimming skills have no role in the prevention of drowning. Public awareness regarding supervision of children and restricting unsupervised access of children to water bodies need to be emphasized.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity in children is an important public health goal in India. Schools may be a target for physical activity promotion, but little is known about outdoor school environments. The purpose of this study was to describe characteristics of the surrounding outdoor school environments that may promote children's physical activity in Delhi, India. <br><br>METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we conducted a structured observation of outdoor school environments in a random sample of 16 private schools in Delhi, India using the Sport, Physical activity and Eating behavior: Environmental Determinants in Young people (SPEEDY) audit tool. The SPEEDY school audit measured six categories, including (1) access to the school; (2) surrounding area; (3) school grounds; (4) aesthetics; (5) usage; and (6) overall environment. Six trained data collectors conducted the audit independently in the summer of 2012 while schools were in session. <br><br>RESULTS: Of the 16 schools, one had cycle lanes separated from the road while two schools had cycle lanes on the road. Two schools had pavement on both sides of the road for pedestrians. One school had marked pedestrian crossings. No schools had school warning signs, road safety signs, or route signs for cyclists that would help calm vehicular traffic. Fifteen schools had playground equipment and nine had courts, an assault course (a sequence of equipment designed to be used together), and a quadrangle (an enclosed or semi-enclosed courtyard) for outdoor physical activity. The majority of schools were shielded from the surrounding area by hedges, trees, or fences (n = 13) and were well maintained (n = 10). One school had evidence of vandalism. Two schools had graffiti, seven had litter, and 15 had murals or art. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of schools did not have infrastructure to support physical activity, such as cycle lanes, marked pedestrian crossings, or traffic calming mechanisms such as school warning signs. However, most had playground equipment, courts, and outdoor play areas. Nearly all were free from vandalism and many had murals or art. These results provide preliminary data for future work examining outdoor school environments, active transport to school, and children's physical activity in India.

N2  - PURPOSE: The epidemiology of pediatric trauma is different in different parts of the world. Some re- searchers suggest falls as the most common mechanism, whereas others report road traffic accidents (RTAs) as the most common cause. The aim of this study is to find out the leading cause of pediatric admissions in Trauma Surgery in New Delhi, India. <br><br>METHODS: Inpatient data from January 2012 to September 2014 was searched retrospectively in Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre Trauma Registry. All patients aged 18 years or less on index presentation admitted to surgical ward/ICU or later taken transfer by the Department of Trauma Surgery were included. Data were retrieved in predesigned proformas. Information thus compiled was coded in unique alphanumeric codes for each variable and subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS version 21. <br><br>RESULTS: We had 300 patients over a 33 month period. Among them, 236 (78.6%) were males and 64 (21.3%) females. Overall the predominant cause was RTAs in 132 (43%) patients. On subgroup analysis of up to 12 years age group (n = 147), the most common cause was found to be RTAs again. However, falls showed an incremental upward trend (36.05% in up to 12 age group versus 27% overall), catching up with RTAs (44.89%). Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) ranged from 0 to 12 with a mean of 8.12 ± 2.022. 223 (74.33%) patients experienced trauma limited to one anatomic region only, whereas 77 (25.66%) patients suffered polytrauma. 288 patients were discharged to home care. Overall, 12 patients expired in the cohort. Median hospital stay was 6 days (range 1-182). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Pediatric trauma is becoming a cause of increasing concern, especially in the developing countries. The leading cause of admissions in Trauma Surgery is RTAs (43%) as compared to falls from height (27%); however, falls from height are showing an increasing trend as we move to younger age groups. Enhancing road safety alone may not be a lasting solution for prevention of pediatric trauma and local injury patterns must be taken into account when formulating policies to address this unique challenge.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: In most regions of the world the global epidemic of traffic injuries is still increasing. In India motor vehicle population is growing at a faster rate than the economic and population growth. It has been estimated that unless immediate action is taken, road deaths will rise to the fifth leading cause of deaths by 2020.The present study was aimed to assess the level of awareness regarding road safety among the study participants and to study the behavior patterns while using motorized vehicles among the study participants. <br><br>METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted in Sri Siddhartha Dental College, Tumkur. All Undergraduate students were included in the study. A total of 200 students were studied. They all drive either their own vehicles or others' vehicles. They were aged from 17-27 years. The study period was from October 2016 to November 2016. <br><br>RESULTS: In total, 200 dental students were studied, ranging from 1st to final year BDS of age 17-27years; the mean age being 21.67 and standard deviation of 3.170.Only 148(74%) wear helmet and only 61(30.5%) interpreted Gap-In-Median correct. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The awareness regarding road safety measures among the study participants was satisfactory but interpretation of traffic signs was poor-only 30.5% interpreted gap-in-median correct. The behavioral patterns among dental students are not satisfactory-only 74% of students wear helmet while riding, only 81.5% wear seat belts and 23.5% don't follow lane rules while driving.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The UN general assembly has declared 2011-2020 as the "Decade of Action for Road Safety". The declaration holds significance because road traffic accidents (RTAs) have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially among the adults and middle aged individuals who constitute economically most productive age groups of society. The importance of knowledge and practice of road safety measures needs to be emphasized in the prevention of RTAs. The present study is aimed to assess the knowledge and practice of road safety measures among the students of a medical college in coastal, South India. A total of 260 medical students were included in this cross-sectional study. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the relevant information from the participants. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS version 11.5. Out of the 260 participants, 149 (57.3%) were females and 111 (42.7%) were males. The overall awareness on road safety measures was slightly higher among females (20.6%) than males (19.9%). The participants had significantly low awareness with regard to alcohol and driving (4.2%), use of seat belts (20%) and use of mobile phones without hands free device (6.1%). The participants had a better knowledge about traffic signs and more than half of them identified all the signs correctly. With regard to the road safety practices, 25% were involved in drunken driving in the past one year. The practice of using mobile phones with hands free devices while driving was admitted by 20% of them. Nearly two-third participants (68%) admitted to have crossed speed limits on multiple occasions. Observations of the study emphasize on the need to generate awareness among medical students through training and IEC activities to curb the epidemic of RTAs.

N2  - Childhood injuries are a major public health challenge in India and globally.     This systematic review was conducted to understand the burden and spectrum of childhood injuries, with a focus on unintentional injuries, among children 5-14 years of age and to suggest approaches to prevention that can be adopted in the Indian context. This systematic review was conducted with the standard approach and use of keywords. A total of 33 studies which were found to be relevant were analyzed.     Road traffic accidents (RTAs) contribute to nearly 85% of all unintentional injuries and related deaths and 90% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in developing countries. Poor traffic regulation, heavy traffic load, and poor skill of identifying the dangerous road crossing sites make the children's age group vulnerable and prone to RTA. Children with poor skill of identification and response to dangerous road crossing sites, along with heavy unregulated traffic were found to be the major reasons for such accidents and make this age group more vulnerable. Public health-based prevention approaches need to be based upon legislation, regulation, and enforcement, as well as environmental modification, education and skill development, emergency medical care using levels of prevention, and principles of targeted prevention to effectively address child health challenges.     Addressing child injuries should be a key component of all endeavors aimed at enhancing child mortality and morbidity rates, as well as the overall welfare of children, both at the national and global levels. It is imperative to prioritize policies focused on preventing unintentional injuries across all age groups, with particular attention to children.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Aim of the study was to ascertain the various causes of unnatural deaths among 1-19 years analysing the postmortem data in a regional referral centre of northern India. A retrospective observational study from the data base was done for the same. All unnatural deaths in children aged 1-19 years from April 2010 to March 2011 were identified from the postmortem database. The children were classified into 3 groups-1-5 years, 6-10 years and 11-19 years separately for males and females. The various modes of unnatural deaths were identified and analysed. Retrospective analysis of Postmortem data during one year revealed total of 434 unnatural deaths in children aged 1-19 years. The most vulnerable age group included children between 11-19 years (74.5%). Females (51.6%) marginaly outnumbered the males (48.4%). Flame Burns (58.3%) was the commonest cause of death in all age followed by road traffic accidents 15%, electrocution 7.8% & Poisoning accounted for 6%. The most frequent victims were adolescents (74%) almost 3 times that of other age group. This study showed Adolescents were the most common victims of the unnatural death with flame burn being the most common cause followed by RTA, electrocution and poisoning.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Proceedings of the 14th World Conference on Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion (Safety 2022)    Background Two-wheeler users accounted for 37% of 1,33,201 persons killed in road crashes in India in year 2019, implying need to strengthen helmet use    Aims To estimate helmet use patterns among two-wheeler users in Bengaluru city; to conduct data-driven advocacy to highlight the problem of non-standard helmet use and seek stricter implementation of standard helmet use.     Methods Between December-2021 - February-2022, we collected Helmet use data across 15 randomly sampled representative locations in Bengaluru city, using a multistage sampling technique. Trained investigators recorded helmet use data using standardized handheld android tablet devices. Helmet use were defined as Standard helmet (fully strapped full-face helmet) and non-standard helmets (unstrapped, inappropriate sizes and types). Each site was observed at different time intervals to capture the varying traffic volume and weather. We performed descriptive analysis to estimate the proportions and patterns of helmet use, and binary logistic regression to estimate the odds of standard helmet use, by select covariates. Ethics approvals was obtained from NIMHANS and JH-IIRU.     Results We observed 98021 two-wheeler users. Overall helmet use was 92% but standard helmet use was just 24%. Nearly 26% of riders and 20% of pillion used cap helmets (low grade non-standard helmet). The odds of standard helmet use were 1.18 times among persons aged 18+ years and 3.3 times among males. Advocacy programmes were held with Police triggered sensitization drive to deter use of cap helmets.     Conclusion Despite the high coverage of helmet use, standard helmet use is significantly low among two-wheeler users, specifically among youth. Widespread use of cap helmets is alarming as they offer no protection against head injuries. We strongly advocate the need for data-driven programmes to reinforce the use of a standard, helmet use.     Learning Outcomes Large scale evidence-based data using robust assessment are useful to advocate for standard helmet use, sensitize traffic police department and the public, leading to stricter enforcement. However such efforts need to be repeatedly and consistently implemented to allow evidence-based policy revisions and enforcement activities for improving standard helmet use.Support - Project funded by Johns Hopkins International Injury Research Unit (JH-IIRU)<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Unnatural deaths in women of reproductive age (range 12-49 years) have a serious psychological and social impact on the family and community. Deaths among women of reproductive age reported as medico-legal cases were investigated to see the trend in terms of cause and manner of death. The study group consisted of a series of 328 consecutive forensic autopsies on women in the reproductive age group, performed between 2009 and 2011 at the Government Wenlock District Hospital, Mangalore, India by qualified specialist forensic medicine experts. Unnatural deaths formed 93.6% of the cohort. The top three causes of death included burns, poisoning and hanging forming 69.5% of the cases. The manner of death was suicide in 45.4% cases, accident in 43.6% cases and homicide in 4.6% cases. The circumstances of death were related to alleged medical negligence in 2.4% cases. Death in 4% cases was natural mannered with a disease being the cause of death. Three-fourths of the victims were married. Married women formed 63.1% of the suicidal victims. Homicidal deaths were not reported among unmarried women. The preponderant method of suicide was by poisoning at 42.3% (63 cases), followed by hanging (34.9%), burns (11.4%) and drowning (9.4%). These four methods comprised 98% of the total suicidal deaths in this study cohort. Accidental deaths were predominantly caused by burns (62.2%) and road traffic accident (23.1%). Two-thirds of the homicidal deaths were due to assault caused by blunt-force trauma, ligature strangulation and sharp-force trauma. One-third of the homicidal victims died due to burns. With a clear understanding of the cause and manner of death, it may be possible to predict, and hopefully prevent, future cases of unnatural deaths in women of reproductive age who form a very important group of society.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children 0-14 years constitute about 31.4% of Indian population, among whom the magnitude and risk factors of childhood injuries have not been adequately studied. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of and assess the factors associated with unintentional injuries among children aged 6 month - 18 years in various regions. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: This multi-centric, cross-sectional, community-based study was conducted at 11 sites across India. States included were Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal between March, 2018 and September, 2020. A total of 2341 urban and rural households from each site were selected based on probability proportionate to size. The World Health Organization (WHO) child injury questionnaire adapted to the Indian settings was used after validation. Information on injuries was collected for previous 12 months. Definitions for types (road traffic accidents, falls, burns, poisoning, drowning, animal-related injuries) and severity of injuries was adapted from the WHO study. Information was elicited from parents/primary caregivers. Data were collected electronically, and handled with a management information system. <br><br>RESULTS: In the 25751 households studied, there were 31020 children aged 6 months-18 years. A total of 1452 children (66.1% males) had 1535 unintentional injuries (excluding minor injuries) had occurred in the preceding one year. The overall prevalence of unintentional injuries excluding minor injuries was 4.7% (95% CI: 4.4-4.9). The commonest type of injury was fall-related (842, 54.8%) and the least common was drowning (3, 0.2%). Injuries in the home environment accounted for more than 50% of cases. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study provide inputs for developing a comprehensive child injury prevention policy in the country. Child safe school with age-appropriate measures, a safe home environment, and road safety measures for children should be a three-pronged approach in minimizing the number and the severity of child injuries both in urban and rural areas.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Children and adolescents are the most vulnerable groups for road traffic injuries in India (39%). Hourly, forty youngsters die in road traffic crashes. Road safety education aims at reducing this burden. Peer-led education (PLE) is a credible approach influencing students to modify their behavior positively. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of PLE in terms of knowledge and attitude toward road safety among adolescents. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: A single-group pretest-posttest design among 113 adolescents was conducted using a two-stage sampling technique. Ten selected and trained student peers provided PLE on road safety to 103 fellow students using a teaching aid. Effectiveness of PLE on knowledge and attitude was assessed pre- and postintervention. <br><br>RESULTS: Post PLE, the mean knowledge score of subjects increased from 10.5 to 17.5 with a significant mean difference of -6.9 (P < 0.001). The mean attitude score of subjects had increased from 46.7 to 48.1. A positive statistically significant correlation (P = 0.04) between knowledge and attitude and associations between certain sociodemographic variables were noted. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Knowledge and attitude of subjects regarding road safety improved after PLE. Innovative teaching methods can be used to promote healthy behaviors among adolescents.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents are considered a public health problem leading to high mortality and morbidity, especially among adolescents and young adults. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of video-assisted teaching to improve the knowledge of road traffic rules among college students and the factors associated with the difference in knowledge.     Methods: We conducted pre-test post-test study among students from a Government Arts and Science college in Puducherry, South India from August to September 2019. We assessed the knowledge related to road traffic rules like road traffic signs, speed limits and penalties related to violation of traffic rules. A video-assisted health education session was provided to all, and change in knowledge assessed. Factors associated with the difference in scores were assessed using an independent t-test or ANOVA test.     Results: A total of 355 college students were included in the study. Of them, 2 (0.56%) had adequate knowledge, 317 (89.3%) had moderate knowledge and 36 (10.14%) had inadequate knowledge regarding traffic rules in the pre-test. During post-test, 47 (13.24%) had moderate knowledge and 308 (86.7%) had adequate knowledge. Overall mean (SD) knowledge score was increased from 14.7 (2.8) to 23.6 (2.5) (p<0.001). Sociodemographic factors were not significantly associated with a change in knowledge scores.     Conclusions: There was a significant difference in knowledge scores of students after the intervention. Continuous reinforcement and education about safety measures can motivate and bring a positive change among them in strictly following traffic rules.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Head injury in infancy and childhood has been documented as the single most common cause of death. In India, children aged <15 years constitute 35% of the total population and contribute to 20-30% of all head injuries. In this study, we attempted to analyze the epidemiological factors, management, and outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of this study were to find the causes of head injury in children and its pattern of distribution in this population and to analyze the efforts required to prevent the injury and management focusing on limiting the progression of primary brain injury and minimizing secondary brain insult. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 2714 patients with head injury were admitted at our hospital during the study period and, out of them, 508 (18.17%) were pediatric patients with age less than 18 years. Of the 508 patients, only 497 patients were included in this study. In the present study, 357 (71.83%) were males and 140 (28.16%) were females. In total, 351 cases were managed conservatively whereas surgical intervention was conducted in 146 cases (P < 0.001). In this study, the most common mode of injury was a road traffic accident (RTA) (46.88%; n=233), followed by fall from height (34.8%; n=173) (P < 0.001). It was also seen that epidural hematoma and fracture hematoma were the most common computed tomography findings in pediatric patients with head injury followed by parenchymal contusion or contusion with or without fracture followed by diffuse axonal injury. A total of 344 cases out of 497 cases were discharged with Glasgow outcome score (GOS)-5 whereas nine cases remained in a persistent vegetative state (GOS-2). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Early intervention aimed at the primary lesion in TBI in children generally carries a good outcome, and limits as much as possible the ongoing biomechanical, physiological, and pathological sequelae post-TBI. In teenagers, the importance of proper self-care along with adequate safety gears while doing any TBI-prone activity should be emphasized.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Among all types of injuries road traffic injuries constitute a major public health problem. They lead to not only deaths but many more cases of morbidity and disability. People from all economic groups are affected but poor are affected the worst because they suffer from double brunt of injuries and also the economic loss; sometimes pushing them below the poverty line. The present study was conducted to study the epidemiological variables involved in road traffic accidents.<br><br>METHODS: 500 road traffic accident victims admitted in emergency department of Rajindra Hospital, a tertiary institute;  attached to Government Medical College, Patiala (Punjab) were studied from July 2002 to February 2003. In this descriptive study pretested proforma was used to know the various epidemiological factors related to road traffic accident victims. The demographic variables, category of road users, details of injured pedestrians and types of vehicles involved in road traffic accidents were studied.<br><br>RESULTS: The road traffic accident victims mainly include the young males, especially 21-30 years (31.4%), married (70.6%), and men (86.8%) mainly literate (66.6%), from rural areas of Punjab. Maximum accidents occurred during night time (8pm- 4am) and major involvement was of two wheelers (63.4%). Mainly drivers were affected in the road crashes (46.6%) followed by pedestrians (21.4%).<br><br>CONCLUSIONS: young male drivers are affected the most, mainly involving two wheelers. There should be regular and continuous on-going traffic safety and awareness programs covering all the media especially directed towards education of drivers, pedestrians and young population; mainly focusing on  the schools and colleges youth.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Trauma is emerging as an epidemic and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Children <15 years of age comprise about 32.8% or about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the total Indian population. In India, up to one fourth of hospital admissions and approximately 15% of deaths in children are due to injury. This study presents the epidemiology, various causes and pattern of musculoskeletal injuries in pediatric population of North India. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an observational, prospective hospital-based study conducted in a tertiary care center of North India for 6 months from July to December 2016. All pediatric patients in the age group 0-15 years who presented to the orthopedic emergency and out patient department with a history of trauma were included in the study. <br><br>RESULTS: Children aged 6-15 years (58%) suffered more injuries than children under 5 years of age (42%). Male pediatric population (58.5%) had more musculoskeletal injuries as compared to female pediatric population of the same age group (41.5%) in both the groups. Urban pediatric population (68.78%) suffered more injuries as compared to rural population of the same age group. Right extremities were more commonly involved in both the age groups. Upper limb injuries (50.59% in 0-5 years age group and 47.42% in 6- 15 years age group) were most common followed by lower limb and pelvic injuries. Very few (2.9% in 0- 5 years age group and 4.8% in 6-15 years age group) patients sustained isolated spinal injuries. Out of the 3712 patients 59.40% of patients had a history of fall, followed by road traffic accident related injuries (32%). The most common injuries were superficial injuries i.e., abrasions and bruises. The second most common injury was cut or open wounds mostly seen on hand, forearm and legs. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The high incidence of pediatric trauma on roads and falls indicates the need for more supervision during playing and identification of specific risk factors for these injuries in our setting. Injuries in pediatric age group by and large is a preventable condition. Therefore, injury prevention in children should be a priority.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The fatalities from Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) constitute a major cause of unnatural deaths among children in Chandigarh zone of North West India. The epidemiology of RTA related deaths in this age group is lacking in our country. This retrospective study (1974-2013) included children (⩽18 years) who became victims of RTA and subsequently died during the course of treatment. The postmortem and hospital records of the victims were used to collect the epidemiological data regarding age, sex, area of residence, etc. These deaths constituted 9.4% of total road accident deaths reported at this hospital. Out of a total of 709 RTA deaths in children, about 16% were reported in the block year of 1974-78 and this proportion decreased to 9.4% during the block year of 1984-88 and has remained almost constant since then. The maximum number of victims belonged to the states of Haryana (36%) and Punjab (34%). A higher number of deaths were observed in rural population (60%). Most of the fatalities occurred between 12-4 pm (29.9%) and pedestrians (47.8%) were found to be the most commonly affected. The most common affected was the 16-18 year age group (35.3%). Injury to head and neck region (81.4%) was responsible for a majority of deaths. The study concluded that the RTA remains an important cause of unnatural deaths in children. The static proportion of these deaths over the past three decades signifies that the road safety policies have been ineffective in preventing causalities and need further improvements.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are an emerging public health issue of global concern causing 1.35 million deaths per year. They are the leading cause of death among 5-29 years who contribute to the future and current productive population of the country. The outcome of mortality and permanent disability are public health concerns. We determined the factors associated with RTAs among medical undergraduates and assessed their knowledge of road traffic rules. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had 500 medical undergraduates from a tertiary hospital located in Chengalpattu district, Tamil Nadu. Data were collected using questions from "Road safety question bank" issued by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India, sent as Google forms to students. Descriptive statistics were used and multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with RTAs. <br><br>RESULTS: The mean age of the students was 21.4 (standard deviation = 1.7) years. About 30.4% of students suffered from RTAs in the past 2 years. Practice of drunken driving and mobile phone usage showed significant association with RTA occurrence (P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression revealed that students crossing speed limits and jumping signals had 3.19 and 2.04 times more risk of sustaining RTAs. Seventy-five percent of students had good knowledge on road traffic rules. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Nearly half the subjects have suffered RTA in the past 2 years. Students who over speed, jumped signals and used mobile phones while driving sustained more RTAs. Overall, road traffic rules knowledge was satisfactory. Students need education on risky driving behaviors and aftermath of crashes.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic crashes (RTC) are one of the leading causes of global mortality, resulting in over 1.35 million deaths every year. It is a leading cause of death among children and young adults. Ethiopia faces an increasing burden of the problem, and several factors are implicated in the rising trend. Issues concerning drivers and their immediate environments play a crucial role in road traffic crashes. This study was conducted to identify the driver determinants in road traffic crashes in Southwest Ethiopia. A community-based case-control study was conducted on a total of 336 drivers (cases, n=111; controls, n=225). Cases were drivers who had caused an RTC in the past year, controls were drivers who had not. Simple random sampling was employed to select participants. Independent determinants of road traffic crashes were identified using the 95 percent confidence interval of the odds ratio at p < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression. Driver and vehicle characteristics that were significant determinants of RTC in the study area were: limited driving experience (AOR: 2.6; 95% CI (1.04, 6.5), alcohol consumption (AOR: 5.17; 95% CI (2.23, 11.7), inconsistent use of seat belts (AOR: 3.19; 95% CI (1.6, 6.3), vehicle years of service (AOR: 2.6; 95% CI (1.3, 5.3) and speeding (AOR: 4.595% CI (2.3-8.9). Mentored driving is recommended to boost the experience of novice drivers. Enforcement of existing laws and behavioural interventions should be strengthened against risky driving practices. Drivers of older vehicles with long intervals between service should be kept under close supervision.     Key Findings     -In India, buses are involved in 5-10 percent of the total and fatal road traffic crashes compared to global figures ranging from 0.5-1.6 percent in developed nations.      -Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) analysis was used to identify frequent Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus crash locations in Delhi.      -Vulnerable road users are involved in 78 percent of total crashes involving public transport buses.      -Steps to enhance safety performance of public transport bus services are discussed.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The young people in the age group of 10-24 yr in India constitutes one of the precious resources of India characterized by growth and development and is a phase of vulnerability often influenced by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect their health and safety. Nearly 10-30 per cent of young people suffer from health impacting behaviours and conditions that need urgent attention of policy makers and public health professionals. Nutritional disorders (both malnutrition and over-nutrition), tobacco use, harmful alcohol use, other substance use, high risk sexual behaviours, stress, common mental disorders, and injuries (road traffic injuries, suicides, violence of different types) specifically affect this population and have long lasting impact. Multiple behaviours and conditions often coexist in the same individual adding a cumulative risk for their poor health. Many of these being precursors and determinants of non communicable diseases (NCDs) including mental and neurological disorders and injuries place a heavy burden on Indian society in terms of mortality, morbidity, disability and socio-economic losses. Many health policies and programmes have focused on prioritized individual health problems and integrated (both vertical and horizontal) coordinated approaches are found lacking. Healthy life-style and health promotion policies and programmes that are central for health of youth, driven by robust population-based studies are required in India which will also address the growing tide of NCDs and injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of unintentional childhood injuries and to assess the impact of injury during childhood. <br><br>METHODS: This is a cross sectional study, conducted in 13 clusters of a rural block in Vellore. Children were screened by two-stage cluster sampling method by two weeks and three months recall method. The primary caregivers of injured children were administered a questionnaire to assess the impact of the injury. <br><br>RESULTS: Childhood injury related morbidity was 292.5 per 1000 y. Children between 10 and 14 y (4.6%) and boys (4.5%) had a higher rate of injury. Fall (43.1 %) was the most common cause of injury followed by RTIs (Road Traffic Incidents- 27.6%). Work absenteeism for primary caregivers ranged from 1 to 60 (IQR 2-7) days. Sickness absenteeism ranged from 1 to 45 d with a mean of 7.64 (IQR 2-7) days. Half of the children missed school after an injury. The days spent with temporary disability ranged from 1 to 60 d with a mean of 11.79 (IQR 2-7) d and 7.73% had permanent disability. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional childhood injury is a neglected public health problem which leads to sickness absenteeism and disability. Boys and older children are the most common victims of injury. There is a need for establishing state or nationwide injury registries to help understand accurate estimates of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) and loss of productivity.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Injuries affect the lives of thousands of young people and their families each year in India. With the gradual decline of communicable and nutritional diseases, injuries will be a leading cause of mortality, morbidity and disabilities and the success achieved so far in child health and survival is in jeopardy. Available data indicate that among children less than 18 y, 10-15 % of deaths, 20-30 % of hospital registrations and 20 % of disabilities are due to injuries. Based on available data, it is estimated that injuries result in death of nearly 1, 00,000 children every year in India and hospitalisations among 2 million children. Road Traffic Injuries (RTI's), drowning, falls, burns and poisoning are leading injury causes in India. Drowning and burns are major causes of mortality in less than 5 y, while RTIs, falls and poisoning are leading causes in 5-18 y. A shift in the occurrence of suicides to younger age groups of 15-20 y is a matter of serious concern in recent years. More number of males, those in rural areas, and majority of poor income households are affected due to injuries.Child injuries are predictable and preventable. Children have limitations of size, development, vision, hearing and risk perceptions as compared to adults and hence are more susceptible and vulnerable to injuries. Thus, it is important to make products and home - road and school environments safer along with greater supervision by parents and care givers. The key approaches include vehicle and product safety, environmental modification, legislation and enforcement, education and skills development along with availability of quality trauma care. Child injury prevention and care requires good quality data, building human and financial resources, strengthening policies and programmes based on evidence and integrated implementation of countermeasures along with monitoring and evaluation. Child injury prevention and control is crucial and should be an integral part of child health and survival.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic continues to be a major developmental issue and a public health concern. Road accidents in India kill almost 1.5 lakh people annually, and India accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the world. Prevention of road traffic accidents is very crucial by creating awareness and taking proper measures toward road safety. AIMS: The aims of this study were to assess the knowledge about road safety regulations and to assess the attitude and practices regarding road safety regulations. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a pharmacy college. <br><br>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Study participants were all 4 academic years' pharmacy students who know driving two- or four-wheeler motor vehicle. Data were collected from a sample of 132 by predesigned pretested semi-structured questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were presented in proportions with confidence interval using SPSS ver. 22. <br><br>RESULTS: 81.1% of the participants knew the minimum age to obtain driving license. Only 16% follow the road signs strictly and 76% wear helmet for long-distance ride. Poor attitude was observed for wearing helmet for short-distance ride, pillion rider wearing helmet, and drink and drive. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the participants were aware of road safety regulations. In spite of having positive attitude toward road safety measures by participants, they could not translate attitude into practice.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and trends of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents in Manipal, Southern India. METHODS: Analysis of all trauma deaths in children and adolescents aged between 1 and 19 years, autopsied between January 1994 and December 2005. The study is based on autopsy records, information furnished by the police, and chemical analysis report. RESULTS: There has been a substantial decline in the incidence of traumatic deaths among children and adolescents during 1994 to 2005. Road traffic injuries were responsible for maximum mortalities (38.4%), followed by those because of burns (24.9%) and poisoning (15.9%). Males comprised 59.6% of cases. Male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Males predominantly died of traffic injuries (45.2%), whereas females as a result of burns (37.4%). There was more than two-fold increase in injury-related mortalities from childhood to adolescence (1:2.3). CONCLUSION: Among children and adolescents, traffic injuries and burns are responsible for maximum injury-related mortalities in males and females, respectively. More injury reducing measures are required for effective reduction in traumatic deaths.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Child injuries are a growing global public health problem that requires urgent attention. They are a significant area of concern from the age of   one year, and progressively contribute more to overall rates of death until the children reach adulthood. So, the authors suggested 'student safety and insurance (SSI) day observance' globally in order to create awareness against prevention of unintentional injuries (UII) and provision of SSI. The review focussed on estimation of the burden and causes of UIIs among students, determination of association of UIIs with socioeconomic factors, identification of the student safety day/week and SSI policies. A descriptive analysis of the articles published in various journals on UIIs among the students across the globe was undertaken. A systematic, predetermined strategy was undertaken for data collection, collation, compilation and assimilation. The authors found that the road traffic injuries alone are leading cause of death among 15-19 and the second leading cause among 10-14 years old (WHO-2008). In addition, millions of children require hospital care for non-fatal injuries. Many are left with some form of disability, often with lifelong consequences. Dr. Gururaj estimated that nearly 100,000 children died every year in India among 2,000,000 hospitalized. Certain universities/nations are observing student safety week. The authors concluded that children are particularly vulnerable group, either directly through being injured themselves or indirectly through the loss of parents. So, a convergent and cost benefit new initiative 'global student safety and insurance day observance' suggested every year in order to prevent all UIIs and to provide insurance.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background With an epidemic of traffic injuries affecting children worldwide, a better understanding of the data, including parent attitudes and behaviours, is essential.     Methods A survey was conducted among a diverse group of 6000 parents in six nations in 2014. In Brazil, China and South Africa, the survey was fielded by phone; in Qatar and India, by interviews; and in the United States, online. To assess the burden of road traffic deaths and injuries on children worldwide, data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study was analysed.     Results More than 90 percent of parents in Brazil, China, India, Qatar and South Africa said more needs to be done to improve road safety for children. More than half of parents in five out of six countries said they are concerned about their child's safety on the way to school. In India, 66 percent of parents expect their child to be seriously hurt in a crash in the next year. In the United States, more than 70 percent of parents worry about their child being hit by a distracted or speeding driver on the way to school. Analysis of GBD data showed that, in 2010, road crashes were the leading cause of death among children ages 5 to 19, with teenagers accounting for nearly half of deaths. More than 90 percent of road deaths among children occurred in low- and middle-income countries.     Conclusions Parents around the world are highly concerned about the safety of their children on the roads. These concerns are justified since road crashes are the leading cause of death for children ages 5 to 19. A strong focus on building awareness, expanding prevention programs, advocating for laws, and enhancing enforcement, consistent with the pillars of the UN Decade of Action on Road Safety, is needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the primary caregivers' perception, and further, their awareness of unintentional childhood injuries in south India.     METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the rural block of Kaniyambadi, Vellore, among 300 primary caregivers of children aged between 0 and 14 years. A semi-structured interview was conducted with the primary caregivers using a photo-elicitation method, with a visual depiction of ten injury risky scenarios for a child. Scoring was done to assess the perception of environmental hazards in these scenarios, and further, knowledge on the prevention of these injuries. An independent 't' test was done to elicit differences in mean scores and a multivariate regression analysis was applied to ascertain factors independently associated with the scores.     RESULTS: Primary caregivers had adequate perception regarding risks posed to children in scenarios such as climbing trees (96.2%), playing near construction sites (96%), firecrackers (96.4%) and crossing unmanned roads with no traffic signals (94%). Knowledge of prevention was poor however, in the following scenarios: a woman riding a bicycle without safety features, with child pillion sitting behind bare foot and legs hanging by one side (72.6%); a child playing near a construction site (85.9%); and a child playing with plastic bags (88.3%). Overall, educational status of the primary caregiver and socioeconomic status were associated with poorer perception of risks and knowledge about unintentional childhood injuries and their prevention.     CONCLUSIONS: Pragmatic community-based childhood interventions incorporated into existing programs, with a special focus on road traffic injuries, burns and suffocation need to be implemented in high-risk settings of rural populations in South India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND:  Youth constitute one of the most vulnerable groups for practicing risky road behaviors. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are one of the leading preventable causes of disability and mortality among children and young adults across the globe.  Objective: To estimate the prevalence of road risk behaviors among college students of Delhi and to determine the factors associated with it. <br><br>METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2020 to September 2021 across five administrative zones in Delhi, India. Six hundred seventy-five undergraduate college students were selected across five colleges using stratified random sampling.  Results: The mean age of the study participants was 19.62 years (S.D. = ± 1.328). Among the study participants, more females (52.6%) were present than males (47.4%). Almost one-fifth of the participants reported not wearing a seat belt while driving or riding in a car during the past 30 days. Some 37.2% of the participants reported using a mobile phone while driving a car within the past 30 days. The prevalence of riding in a car driven by a person after drinking alcohol was 17.4%. Similarly, the prevalence of drinking and driving was 17.2% amongst the study participants. The prevalence of not wearing a helmet while driving or riding a two-wheeler vehicle was 42.6%. The overall prevalence of risky road behaviors was 16.7%. The multivariate analysis results revealed the odds of road risk behaviors to be significantly higher among those who were alcohol users (adjusted odds ratio, aOR=7.3, confidence interval, CI=3.8-13.8), substance abusers (aOR=2.4, CI=1.4-4.3), and those belonging to rural areas (aOR=4.2, CI=2.4-7.3). <br><br>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of road safety-related risky health behaviors was high among the study participants. The significant road-risk behaviors were not wearing a helmet while riding or driving a two-wheeler vehicle, texting or talking while driving, and driving a car under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric trauma is emerging as an epidemic worldwide; the epidemiology of pediatric trauma is different in different parts of the world. There are very few studies describing the pediatric trauma in developing countries. <br><br>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the type, mechanism, and extent of trauma among pediatric trauma patients and its association with clinical outcome. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: This was a prospective observational study conducted in the department of emergency medicine and trauma at a tertiary care hospital in South India from September 2015 to March 2017. All children aged <12 years with a history of injuries irrespective of the cause for attending our trauma center were included in the study. OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS: Of the 911 children enrolled, 63.9% sustained injuries at home. The leading modes of injury were fall at level ground (26.9%), road traffic accidents (RTAs) (25.5%), and fall from height (16.8%). Majority of RTA victims were two-wheeler pillion riders (40.5%) and pedestrians (31.9%). Nearly 49% of children had head and maxillofacial injuries. Polytrauma was found in 3.6% of children. Based on the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS), 72.6% of children had mild trauma and 6.1% severe trauma. Totally, 18.9% of children required inpatient management, 7.5% surgical intervention, and 1.8% expired. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Most of injuries in children occurred at home. This was followed by injuries on road. The leading cause of polytrauma was RTA. RTA victims were more likely to have severe injuries and poor outcome. They were more likely to require inpatient management compared to those who fell from height or fell at level ground. Glasgow Coma Scale and PTS may be used reliably to assess the severity of injuries sustained by children.<br><br>Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Emergencies, Trauma, and Shock.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Road traffic accidents (RTA) are the biggest killers according to the Global Status Report on Road Safety. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess the road safety in the vicinity of the educational institutions in the city of Mangaluru in South India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Considering the proportion of educational institutions having road safety standards in place as 50%, absolute error as 5%, and z as 1.96 ( 95% confidence level), the required sample size was about 100 institutions. It was decided to sample approximately 100 each of government and private education institutions from a total of about 964 schools and colleges in the city limits of Mangaluru and survey them using a comprehensive checklist prepared based on some previous studies. <br><br>RESULTS: Of the 200 schools observed for road safety features using a preformed checklist, 124 (62%) were located on the main road, 76 (38%) had an approach road from the main road to reach the school. Of these only 23 (11.5%) of institutions had road sign showing school/college, 14 (7%) had a signage showing children crossing, 37 (18.5) had a speed breaker for slowing of traffic and only 2 (1%) had zebra crossing. Sixty four (32%) institutions had parking space and 12 (6%) had sidewalk/pavement for safety. <br><br>CONCLUSION: It was found that the road safety features and the safe environment around the schools were inadequate putting children, young adults and the employees of these institutions at risk.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Motorcycles are one of the most commonly used transportation modes in low and middle-income countries. In India, motorized two-wheelers comprise 70% of the total vehicle population, and motorcycle users are considered the most vulnerable road users. It is essential to understand the risky riding behaviour and associated factors among the motorcyclists to develop evidence-based traffic safety programs targeting motorcycle riders. The purpose of the current study was two-fold. First, it aimed to determine the appropriate structure of a modified version of the MRBQ among young riders in Manipal, India. Second, it assessed to what extent MRBQ factors were associated with self-reported crash involvement and violations. <br><br>METHODS: The motorcycle rider behaviour questionnaire (MRBQ) is a 43-item scale that assesses five aspects of risky motorcycle rider behaviour, i.e., violations, control errors, traffic errors, stunts, and protective equipment. The MRBQ, along with measures of socio-demographic variables and the number of motorcycle crashes, was filled out by 300 young motorcycle riders who were in the age group of 18-25 years and had been riding for at least the past three years (93% males, 92.3% students). <br><br>RESULTS: Five factors emerged out of the MRBQ after an exploratory factor analysis: traffic errors, control errors, stunts, protective equipment, and violations. Cronbach's alpha for these factors ranged from.66 to.82. Reports of performing stunts and committing violations were positively associated with self-reported near-crash experiences over the past three months. Riders reporting stunts, violations and using a motorcycle of 125-200 cc reported having received more fines in the last three months. These findings were confirmed in both univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The study assessed the factor structure of a modified version MRBQ and the extracted factors associations with self-reported crash involvement. The factor structure revealed in the current study is consistent with MRBQ factor structures found in other countries. However, the support for a relationship between MRBQ factors and self-reported crashes was less significant. The findings suggest that if replicated by future studies, local policymakers are advised to focus on the five MRBQ factors while planning future interventions to achieve a reduction in the number of road crashes among motorcyclists.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: India accounts to 10% of global road deaths. In 2013 around 1,40,000 people were killed and 5,00,000 were severely injured or disabled. Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a major health problem among young people. Children are vulnerable road users and safety issues near school zones are the major cause of concern. Improper road safety measures can seriously affect the safeness and security of school children. In this context the study was conducted to observe road safety features in close vicinity around all schools in Dharwad city Karnataka, India.     Methods: An observational study was carried out in Dharwad city focusing the safe environment around the 43 schools, which included both the government and the private schools. Data was collected from 1st April 2014 to 30th April 2014. All schools in the city were included for the study purpose.     Results: Total 43 schools were observed for road safety features, we found that the road safety features and the safe environment around the schools were inadequate putting children at risk.     Conclusions: We concluded that there is a need for immediate action and the responsible local authorities should take up this issue as top priority and implement the corrective road safety measures for the health of school children.

N2  - <p>Road safety is both a health and development issue of concern. Road traffic injuries are one of the leading causes of deaths, disabili- ties and hospitalizations with severe socioeconomic costs across the world and India in particular. As per the ‘Road Accidents in India 2020’, there were 3,66,138 unfortunate road accidents during 2020, which claimed 1,31,714 lives and caused injuries to 3,48,279 per- sons [1]. As per the World Health Organization, at least one out of 10 persons killed on roads across the world is from India and India positions first in the number of road accident deaths worldwide. The youth are particularly vulnerable on the world’s roads, and road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 years [2]. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) has considered road safety an issue of paramount importance. It has been taking proactive steps to address it by a technique called 4Es, Education, Engineering (of both roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency care. Hence instruction and education to the adolescent and youth are of utmost importance to prevent road traffic accidents [1].    Many research studies evaluating the awareness of children, adolescents, and youths have shown less information on road traffic rules. The knowledge regarding the safety and traffic rules among the medical students in Pakistan was inadequate. The finding will help plan future accident prevention programs and emphasise the need to generate awareness among medical students through train- ing and awareness activities [3].    Road traffic injury prevention must be incorporated into a broad range of activities, such as the development and management of road infrastructure, the provision of safer vehicles, law enforcement, mobility planning, the provision of health and hospital services, child welfare services, and urban and environmental planning [4, 5].    A study among medical students reported that wearing a helmet and following the traffic rules were not practiced and the overall knowledge and practice toward road safety was poor [6]. Another study shows that awareness is not common among people, and ...</p>  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic accidents have emerged as the new public health challenge of the 21st century. There has been an unprecedented upsurge in the area of auto mobilization like never before in the post-liberalization era in India. With a population close to 1.37 billion people, India now faces the worst ever road congestion in most of the areas. Indian roads are the most vulnerable road in the world. Road traffic injuries are the sixth leading cause of death in India. It is imperative to comprehensively understand the underlying behavioural factors related to road traffic accidents. Literature related to traffic behaviour is sparse in India. The current paper intends to highlight behaviours & underlying determinants, which cause road traffic accidents (RTA). Drunken riding, cell phone usage & tailgating are some of the risky riding behaviour prominent among the young riders in India. The informed evidence from the current review can provide valuable leads to the policymakers at the local level to initiate targeted interventions.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the road use pattern and incidence and risk factors of non-fatal road traffic injuries (RTI) among children aged 5-14 years in Hyderabad, India. METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based survey, data were collected on 2809 participants aged 5-14 years (98.4% participation) selected using multi-stage cluster sampling. Participants recalled non-fatal RTI during the previous 3 and 12 months. RTI was defined as an injury resulting from a road traffic crash irrespective of severity and outcome. RESULTS: Boys (11.5) had a higher mean number of road trips per day than girls (9.6), and the latter were more likely to walk and less likely to use a cycle (p<0.001). With increasing household income quartile, the proportion of trips using cycles or motorised two-wheeled vehicles increased while trips as pedestrians decreased (p<0.001). Based on the 3-month recall period, the age-sex-adjusted annual rate of RTI requiring recovery period of >7 days was 5.8% (95% CI 4.9-6.6). Boys and girls had similar RTI rates as pedestrians but boys had a three times higher rate as cyclists. Considering the most recent RTI in the last 12 months, children of the highest household income quartile were significantly less likely to sustain pedestrian RTI (0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.86). The odds of overall RTI were significantly higher for those who rode a cycle (2.45, 95% CI 1.75-3.42) and who currently drove a motorised two-wheeled vehicle (2.83, 95% CI 1.60-5.00). CONCLUSION: These findings can assist in planning appropriate road safety initiatives to reduce cycle and pedestrian RTI among children to reduce RTI burden in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic accidents (RTAs) contribute significant DALYs in the global burden of diseases. Vulnerable groups particularly pedestrians and children are at an increased risk. Road use pattern, street crossing habits, and road safety awareness are important determinants of RTAs. The present study was carried out to assess the road use pattern and street crossing habits of schoolchildren. This cross-sectional study included 497 schoolchildren of 12-15 years. The interview technique was used as a tool for data collection on a predesigned questionnaire. A total of 40.4% of schoolchildren did not like to go to school alone and wanted somebody from the family to drop them to school. About one quarter of the students were afraid of traffic and expressed their inability to deal with traffic on the road. A total of 10.7% reported crossing the street in groups, and 1.4% reported running while crossing the street. Only 80.9% of students received some form of road safety training, and the parents and schools were the major source of information for such safety training. Age <14 years and a lower level of mother's education were found to be significant contributors for poor road crossing habit in univariate as well as multivariate analysis. The study suggests that the knowledge regarding safe road use and street crossing was lacking among study participants albeit in a small proportion only. Safety aspects can be partly strengthened by imparting practical knowledge about road use pattern, street crossing habits, and road safety procedures.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road crashes has been the prime cause of deaths in young age people (15-25 years). Though statistics and facts suggest that the age group of 15-25 years are the most vulnerable to road crashes but a microscopic study in the desired age group was missing. The age group was divided into 4 different categories i.e. 1518, 18-21, 21-24, and >24 years. A questionnaire was prepared containing questions related to various causes of road crashes including age, category of victim and type of injury suffered. Data was collected from an emerging smart city of India i.e. Bhubaneswar. The analysis was done by logistic regression modeling. The results revealed that in the age range of 15-25 years, it is 18-21 years age group which have the highest probability of facing a severe road crash. The probability decreases as age increases. On an average, a driver of 18-21 years age group has 100 times more chance of facing a severe road crash. Along with victims' age, time of day and type of lighting, traffic movement, character of road, type of junction, speed of vehicle, kind of vehicles involved, land use on both sides of road, drivers' license and helmet use were also found to be significantly affecting the road crashes. A questionnaire was prepared to collect the data related to causes of road crashes including age of driver and type of injury sustained. The obtained data were first analysed for statistical significance and then modelling was done using logistic regression. Speed of vehicle above 80 kmph is considered a catastrophe for riders. Similarly not using helmet increases the chances of an accident being severe by around 400 times. The modelled equations predict the severity of road crashes accurately by taking into account all the independent variables, including age groups, speed of the vehicle, helmet use, etc.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Studies on traffic accidents among underage users of motorcycles are seldom seen in literature. This study was done in Yamunanagar, India where boys as young as 8 years ride motorcycles. It attempts to find out the behavioural and non-behavioural factors leading to motorcycle use and the predisposition to accidents among male school children aged between 10 and 16 years. A questionnaire was used to evaluate those factors among 1760 subjects in 38 schools. Fifteen percent of subjects had had an accident while riding motorcycle. Most of the behavioural and all the non-behavioural factors have a statistically significant influence on accident proneness. Aggressive behaviour and previous encounter with the police are the two strong predictors of accidents (p<0.001). Children as riders are exposed to higher risks of accident and longer life with disability. It also explains how these children behaviourally take up adult roles and seek adult risk taking attitudes. The implications of child motorcycle riders upon children themselves and on the society are discussed for a greater discourse on road safety motorcycle riding policy and to highlight the behavioural and non-behavioural factors that are associated with traffic accidents.     <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Background  Sensation Seeking is one of the complex behaviors among novice drivers, which leads to road traffic injuries. Globally, road traffic crashes are a leading cause of death among young people, the main cause of death among those who fall in the age group of 15-29 years. Road traffic injuries are currently estimated to be the ninth leading cause of death across all age groups globally and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030. As per the World Health Organization (WHO) report, low and middle-income countries lose approximately 3% of GDP as a result of road traffic crashes.     Objective  To assess the sensation-seeking behavior among novice drivers in Udupi Taluk.     Methodology  The cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the sensation-seeking behavior among novice drivers with an estimated sample size of 150. The study participants were selected by using the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) form V questionnaire developed by Zuckerman. The questionnaire includes 40 questions which are divided into four sub-scales which include boredom susceptibility, disinhibition, experience-seeking, thrill and adventure-seeking. Each sub-scale contains ten items and scoring is given with two options as High and Low. Data collected is analyzed by using Microsoft Excel, SPSS and presented as descriptives i.e., frequency and percentage.     Results  The results were examined according to the levels of sensation seeking scale. Sensation seeking for boredom susceptibility is 22.3% (High), disinhibition is 27.27% (High), experience seeking is 28.6% (High), thrill and adventure-seeking is 60.6% (High). Cross-tabulating the questions with age, gender, education was statistically significant (p < 0.05) associated with risky driving behavior among novice drivers.     Conclusion  Thus, this study reveals that most of the participants are showing a high percentage of thrill and adventure-seeking compared to the remaining three sub-scales, which calls for localized intervention targeting it.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - AIM: To study various risk factors which leads to head injury, severity of head injury and to compare survival as predicted by the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) in pediatric patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital.     Methods: 300 consecutive pediatric patients below 12 years of age with head injury admitted in our institute were analysed as per a set proforma. Data pertaining to patient's demographic details, mode of injury, computed tomography (CT) findings, type of management, severity of head injury, and outcome were recorded. The results were tabulated and analyzed. RTS and PTS scores were calculated to predict the survival of an individual patient.     Results: The most commonly affected age group was 1-5 years. Boys outnumbered girls in the incidence. Fall was the most common injury, with road traffic accident being the most common cause of mortality. Skull fracture was the most common CT scan finding. Most of the patients presented with mild head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15), and they improved with conservative management only. RTS and PTS scores were calculated and were equally effective in predicting the outcome for a particular patient.     Conclusion: Head injury occurs more commonly in 1-5 years' age group due to fall from unprotected roof tops. The overall prognosis in majority of the cases is excellent. However, road traffic accident shows the highest mortality and hence, we propose to include mode of injury as a variable for designing future predictive outcome models.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Paediatrics is a branch of medicine which is concerned with wellbeing of infants, children, adolescents, their physical, mental, and psychological development. Paediatric forensic autopsy is useful to evaluate us the natural and unnatural childhood deaths, their reasons, steps for prevention and their management, which is both useful to the branch of Forensic Medicine and the Medical researchers. A 3 year retrospective study was conducted in M.P. Shah Government Medical College, Jamnagar during the period of January 2014 to December 2016. Out of total 3743 autopsies performed, a total of 253 cases belonging to paediatric age-group were the material of the study.     Accidental deaths are the most common manner of deaths and mostly affected age-group is 12-17 years. The leading cause of death are burns, drowning, road traffic accidents and snake bite. Accidental burns and suicidal hanging were more common in females in the age-group 12-17 years. Accidental drowning and RTA were common in the males. In the present study, snake bite envenomation was also one of the leading causes of unnatural deaths in children and was mostly seen in the age range of 2-10 years.   In India, both natural and unnatural childhood deaths are emerging as major public health problem. Various educational programmes, preventive strategies, and dissemination of information are necessary to create awareness and is must to reduce the unnatural deaths.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Injuries are an emerging public health issue among children worldwide, and one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years lost for children aged 0-14 years. Few studies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, have analysed characteristics and risk factors for these injuries. <br><br>METHODS: This study examined the occurrence and risk factors of serious non-fatal injuries in children aged 7-9 years (n=1820) from Andhra Pradesh, India. Logistic regression models were used to explore potential risk factors for these injuries. <br><br>RESULTS: Based on a 3-year recall period, 336 (18.5%) children reported serious non-fatal injuries. Incidence was higher among males (209/971; 21.5%) compared to females (127/849; 15.0%). Of the most serious non-fatal injuries reported, falls (n=186, 55.4%) were the major cause of injuries, followed by road traffic injuries (50, 14.9%), and assaults/blows/hits (26, 7.7%). Twenty children (6.0%) did not fully recover from their injuries, and 14 (4.2%) had long-term health problems as a result of their injuries. The logistic regression analyses indicated that being male (AOR 1.59; 95% CI 1.25-2.05), in poor health (AOR 2.50; 95% CI 1.88-3.31), and having a caregiver with low education (AOR 1.53; 95% CI 1.15-2.05) were associated with an increased risk of non-fatal injury. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Urgent attention is needed to reduce child injuries and address risk factors according to local context.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Children are vulnerable to musculoskeletal injuries both at home and on the street for various reasons. Morbidity and disabilities resulting from these, mostly preventable, injuries, make them a burden to their families and society. The role of various factors associated with injuries is often not documented. <br><br>METHODS: This prospective study, done on 100 children aged up to 12 years with musculoskeletal trauma, analysed in details, the various modes of injuries. <br><br>RESULTS: One in every five patient was a child below 12 years of age. Boys were injured more than girls. Injuries, especially fractures, were most common in the extremities, the upper limb more commonly injured than the lower limb. Most of the injuries occurred at home. The most common mode of injuries was falls that happened while playing both within and outside the home, followed by road traffic accidents. Most injuries occurred during daytime. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Injuries in children were found to be preventable. Small interventions while constructing homes can contribute tremendously to injury prevention and control in children. Parental awareness about the various modes of injury, role of supervised playing and their responsibility towards injury prevention can play a key role in reducing the morbidity associated with childhood fractures.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Despite Indian children constituting approximately 31.4% of the population aged 0 to 14, a comprehensive exploration of childhood injuries within this demographic remains limited. This study aimed to examine the occurrence of unintentional injuries among children aged six months to 18 years in the Siddlagatta area and assess associated risk factors. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: A community-based, cross-sectional study on unintentional child injuries was carried out from March 2018 to September 2020 across 11 sites in India. Employing a two-stage cluster sampling method with probability proportionate to size, 2341 urban and rural families were selected from each site. Data on unintentional injuries sustained over the past 12 months were collected using the WHO child injury questionnaire, tailored and validated for the Indian context. <br><br>RESULTS: The study encompassed 10,335 individuals in households, including 2695 children aged 6 months to 18 years. Among them, 309 children experienced 390 unintentional injuries in the preceding year, excluding minor incidents. A prevalence rate of 11.5% (95% CI: 10.3-12.7) was identified for unintentional injuries among children, excluding minor cases. Falls were the most prevalent injury type (183 cases, 53.8%), while poisoning incidents were the least frequent (one case, 0.2%). More than 50% of incidents occurred within domestic settings. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: This study's outcomes underscore the prominence of fall-related injuries across all age groups and genders. Homes and schools emerged as primary settings for these injuries, highlighting the need for targeted preventive measures.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people globally, especially in developing countries and burden is more among males compared to females. Human behaviors play a significant role in road traffic Injuries (RTIs), understanding road user behaviors, perception and gender differences in them is very essential to plan strategic road traffic injury prevention programs. The objectives of this study behaviors, risk perception and gender differences in young road users of a district of South India.     Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken among 2000 young people in the age group of 18-25 years in a district of South India.     Results: More than half of the youth reported unsafe behaviors as a road user. Risk behaviors such as playing on roads, using mobile while on road, high speed driving, hanging on to the doors of the bus were reported more in male gender. More than 40% perceived not following traffic safety norms as safe without significant gender differences.     Conclusions: Young road users of South Indian district irrespective of gender, do not follow majority of safety norms and they perceived its safe not to follow them.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study was to enlighten the prevalence, different types & impact of injuries in elderly population in rural area of middle income country (India).     Methods: It was a community based descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted in all 24 villages under one Primary Health Centre of central India. The study was carried out from June 2009 to May 2011.     Results: In the present study, prevalence of injury was 17.1%, which was highest among elderly ageing 65-69 years (36.8%) followed by elderly ageing 60-64 years (27.4%). Prevalence of injury was higher (20%) among males as compared to females (14%). Association of age, gender and injury was not statistically significant. Fall was the most common cause (34.7%) of injury followed by occupational (34.0%) and road traffic accidents (15.8%). Superficial injuries were the most common (32.6%) type of injuries followed by fracture (27.3%). Hospital admission required by 24.2% of elderly. We found 34.7% elderly was physically impaired and 26.3% physically disabled due to various injuries.     Conclusions: In the present study we found injuries pose a major public health problem in elderly. Therefore there is a need of community based assessment on impact of injury among elderly in various parts of country to formulate appropriate health initiatives for prevention and optimum treatment of injuries in elderly.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - PURPOSE: Hip fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly; however, the current literature on the injury patterns of hip fractures in India is lacking. Understanding the injury profile of these patients is important to develop targeted interventions to prevent hip fractures. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of all hip fracture patients aged 50 years or older admitted from February 2019 to December 2019. Details about the injury were recorded by an in-person interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with any particular injury mechanism. <br><br>RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-three hip fractures were included. The mechanism of injury for the majority of patients was a fall from a standing height (n=217, 76.7%) while 60 patients (21.2%) were injured as the result of a road traffic accident (RTA). Slipping on a wet floor (n=49, 22.6%) and change in posture (n=35, 16.1%) were the most commonly reported reasons for falling. Pedestrian injuries were the most common form of RTA (n=29, 48.3%). Increasing age (P<0.001) and female sex (P=0.001) were associated with fall as the mode of injury while sustaining another fracture in addition to hip fracture (P=0.032) was associated with RTA as the mode of injury. <br><br>CONCLUSION: A fall from standing height is the predominant mode of injury among elderly hip fractures especially among women. Environmental hazards and postural changes are responsible for the majority of falls while pedestrian accidents contribute to a majority of the RTAs.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Traffic related pedestrian injuries are a growing public health threat all over the world. When a vehicle strikes with any individual it causes injury. Severity of the injury depends upon the force of collision between the two. The shape and size of different vehicles are different so the impact of injury will be different. The findings of this study are mostly confined to hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh. The findings of this study show maximum number of pedestrian RTA (road side accidents) are not on weekends in contrary of earlier studies. On studying the impact from the body of victim we can tell the type of vehicle. It has great importance in forensic science and for the investigating team of the accident. It will ease the work of investigating officer and the forensic examiner. The present study will help in improving the knowledge of injury according to the impact. This study helps in understanding the cause of accidents and different preventing measures to avoid accidents. Senior citizens are mostly affected in pedestrian injury in our study. According to union transport ministry 62 pedestrian die daily in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

The study analyses the pattern of injuries and the various factors that predict the treatment plan of these patients. A retrospective study was carried out in 1820 trauma patients who reported to the Sri. Ramachandra Dental College and Hospital and required maxillofacial intervention, over a period of 5 years (October 2000 and September 2005). Of the total trauma victims, 185 patients were found to be aged 60 years more. In the majority of the patients, the injury was due to road traffic accidents (79.4%). Males (72.4%) sustained more injuries than females (27.6%). Soft tissue injuries were seen in 49.1% of the patients, while 14% had mandibular fractures. People in their early 60s were injured more often than their older counterparts. The findings of this study highlight the present situation with regard to maxillofacial trauma in patients aged 60 years and older and its management in this part of the country.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Injuries are considered as an emerging public health problem in India. Globally every year, injuries kill more than 5 million people, and by 2020, injuries will be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of nonfatal home injuries among the elderly in Tamil Nadu. <br><br>METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 1139 elderly (60 years and above), sampled from three districts of Tamil Nadu, India. Probability proportional to size sampling technique was used for sampling; a pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. <br><br>RESULTS: Prevalence of nonfatal home injuries among elderly within the past 1 year was 14.6% (12.5-16.7 at 95% confidence interval), (<i>n</i> = 1003), among those injured, 94.5% were unintentionally injured and 5.5% were of intentional nature. When classified according to the types of injuries, majority of them had fall injuries (6.7%) followed by minor domestic injuries (5.4%), animal-related injury (0.2%), burn injuries (1.1%), road traffic injury (0.4%), and suicide attempt (0.8%). Majority of the respondents were in the age group of young-old, 60-69 years of age (84%), and there was more number of males (55%) in the study. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The study reveals that nonfatal home injuries among elderly are an emerging public health problem, unintentional injuries contribute to the majority of the injuries, fall was the single largest contributor for all injuries among elderly.<br><br>Copyright: © 2019 Indian Journal of Community Medicine.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - PRéCIS:: In India, older drivers with glaucoma show greater driving difficulty but are not involved in higher number of on-road accidents. To achieve balance between safety aspects and independence for drivers with glaucoma is important. <br><br>PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze driving habits of patients with glaucoma and to compare their driving behavior, driving difficulties, and accident rates with nonglaucoma controls. PATIENTS: Patients with glaucoma aged older than 40 years were recruited. Subjects with best-corrected visual acuity ≤6/24 in the better-seeing eye and those having primary eye disorder other than glaucoma were excluded. Age-matched nonglaucoma controls were recruited. Subjects with clinically significant cataract and/or with best-corrected visual acuity ≤6/24 in both eyes were excluded. All cases and controls were legally licensed to drive. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, Driving Habits Questionnaire was used. Collected data were statistically analyzed using SAS, version 9.2 (GLM procedure), and IBM SPSS, version 22. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. <br><br>RESULTS: All controls and 84% (n=84/100) of cases were current drivers. Among them, 16% (n=16/100) cases had stopped driving, of which 31.25% (n=5/16) had stopped because of self-reported ocular causes. Cases drove lesser number of days per week (P=0.001) and had more driving dependence on other drivers (44%, n=37/84) compared with controls. Glaucoma was significantly associated with driving difficulty in the rain, in rush-hour traffic, and at night. Comparing driving difficulty scores and visual field index within glaucoma group showed statistical significance [F(1,82)=22.12, P<0.001]. Composite scores of driving difficulty (P<0.001) and driving space (P=0.003) between the 2 groups showed strong statistical significance. Controls had higher number of self-reported accidents (P<0.001). <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with glaucoma show greater driving difficulty, self-regulate their driving behavior, and restrict their driving. Older patients with glaucoma in India are not involved in higher rates of on-road crash risks compared with nonglaucoma drivers.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Unintentional injuries are one of the main contributors to mortality and disability in elderly populations in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this study was to examine the annual road traffic and other bodily (not including falls) injury prevalence and associated risk factors among older adults across six lower and upper middle-income countries. A cross- sectional survey involving face-to-face household interviews were conducted in China (n=13,177), Ghana (n=4305), India (n=6560), Mexico (n=2318), the Russian Federation (n=3938) and South Africa (n=3840), resulting in population-based cohorts of persons aged 50+ years.  Measures included questions on injury, self-rated visual difficulties, alcohol use, depression treatment, sleeping problems, self-reported health status, and vision assessment using LogMAR (logarithm of Minimum Angle of Resolution) eye charts. It comprises rows of letters and is used to measure visual acuity. <br><br>RESULTS indicate that the overall annual non-fatal road traffic injury prevalence was 2.0% and for other bodily injury 2.1% (not including falls) across the six countries. The multivariate logistic regression analysis found that residing in a rural area, taking medications or other treatment for depression in the past 12 months and having a sleeping problem were associated with road traffic injury, while younger age, residing in a rural area, hazardous or harmful alcohol use and having a sleeping problem were associated with other bodily injury. Visual impairment was not associated with prevalence of road traffic injuries. This study provides the burden of non-fatal road traffic injury and other bodily injury and their associated risk factors across the six countries' studies. The findings of this study improves the understanding of non-fatal road traffic injury and other bodily injury upon which policy makers, programme developers and researchers in public health can design strategic interventions to reduce these preventable injuries as well as improve safety associated with unintentional injuries.<br><br>KEYWORDS: injury, traffic, ageing, China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation, South Africa.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - PURPOSE: Glaucoma affects different aspects of vision including visual field. This prospective observational study aims to collect details of driving license (DL) renewal procedure (in an urban metro in India) among patients with diagnosed glaucoma and the method of reporting of vision-related requirements during renewal. <br><br>METHODS: One-hundred patients with diagnosed glaucoma above 40 years, having valid DL (with at least one renewal cycle), were included. Patients with other ocular comorbidities were excluded. Driving Habits Questionnaire and a questionnaire about license renewal were administered. Driving eligibility was compared to international guidelines. <br><br>RESULTS: Study population included patients with 69% early, 29% moderate, and 2% advanced glaucoma. Sixteen percent of patients had stopped driving. Legal license renewal procedure was bypassed by 45%. Form-1 was not submitted by 43% and 49% did not submit Form-1A at the time of renewal. Only 7.01% mentioned about glaucoma in the self-declaration form. None were asked about their visual field during renewal. Among 61 patients who submitted a medical certificate, the undersigning doctor was an ophthalmologist in only six patients. Thirty percent patients with valid Indian DL would not have satisfied International College of Ophthalmologists guidelines. Driving difficulties were experienced by 44%, more so in advanced glaucoma (F (1, 82) = 22.12, P < 0.001). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Vision-related testing at the time of renewal of DL is inadequate in India. Chronic eye diseases such as glaucoma are commonly not self-declared or detected at pre-renewal testing. Clear-cut guidelines about visual requirements and implementation are required to prevent road traffic events because of vision-related errors.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - CONTEXT: Childhood injuries are a less explored area of public health. In the presence of public health problems such as communicable and noncommunicable diseases, childhood injury has gained less attention from the health system. AIMS: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of various types of unintentional injuries (UI) amongst children and to assess the factors associated with same. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at Ahmedabad District of Gujarat State, and this is a cross-sectional sStudy. <br><br>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The current study was a part of a multicentric national level research supported by Indian Council of Medical Research. Total 11 sites were selected across India, which all followed a uniform methodology. One of the selected sites was Dholka taluka of Ahmedabad district, Gujarat. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2341 households. The study participants were children aged from 6 months up to 18 years. A total of 3018 children and their caretakers were interviewed using software-based questionnaire. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis was performed by frequencies and Percentage, Chi-square Test, Z-Test. <br><br>RESULTS: The overall prevalence of injuries was 7.62%. Gender and area of residence were significantly associated with UI. Fall-related injuries had the highest prevalence (3.38%), followed by road traffic injuries (RTI) (1.62%). The prevalence of burn-related injuries and poisoning was higher among females compared to males. No mortality was observed due to UI. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the injuries were of minor or trivial type. Fall-related injury and RTI were the most common types of UIs among children.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Childhood injuries are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We evaluated the type of pediatric injuries encountered in the emergency room amongst 225 children (boys 151, girls 64; age range, 2 mo-12 yr). Data were collected using a structured injury proforma over a period of 12 months. Injuries occurred at home (n=137, 60.8%), street (n=38, 16.8%), and playground (n=37, 16.4%). Most frequent injuries were falls (n=144, 64%) and road traffic injuries (RTI) (n=37, 16.4%). Injuries mostly consisted of fractures (n=72, 32%), bruises (n=39, 17.3%), and lacerations (n=35, 15.5%). Child abuse was recognized in 7 (3.5%) children. There was an average delay of 2 hour 50 minutes to reach the medical facility.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of injuries among children (<14 years) in a rural population. METHODS: The present Cross Sectional Study was undertaken in rural Pondicherry. The trained second year medical undergraduate students paid house visits to all houses in five feasibly selected villages. The students interviewed the mother of children aged <14 years and obtained information on injuries in last 1 year and its sources of treatments. The authors could obtain information for 1,613 households (96.7%). The data was entered and analyzed using Epi_info 6.04d software package. RESULTS: Overall, prevalence of injuries among below 14 years was 23% in the last 1 year. The prevalence of injuries among infants, 1-4 years children and 5-14 years children was 32 (15.2%), 110 (24.5%) and 274 (23.7%) respectively. Prevalence of injury was significantly higher among male children (p = 0.001). All injuries were accidental and 68.2% injuries occurred in home environment followed by that in school. Source of treatment for majorities of injuries (58.4%) were government doctors. Notably, village level Anganwadi workers (AWW) or Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) were not consulted for the treatment. Falls were the leading cause of injury. Fall on ground from height, burns, bite by scorpion/insect/snake/dogs, and road traffic accidents were the four leading causes of injury among children. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for community based health education intervention for mothers, caregivers, school teacher and capacity building of village level health workers such as ANM and AWW. Health education message should include preventive measures for the leading causes of childhood injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - AIM: To assess the epidemiology, pattern, and outcome of trauma in pediatric population. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1148 pediatric patients below 15 years of age presenting in the emergency department of our hospital were studied over a period of 3 years. The patients were categorized into four age groups of <1 year, 1-5 years, 6-10 years, and 11-15 years. The data were compared regarding mode of trauma, type of injury, place of injury among different age groups and both sexes. <br><br>RESULTS: The majority of the pediatric trauma cases were seen in males 69.86%, (n = 802) and females comprised only 30.13% (n = 346). Road traffic accident (RTA) was the most common mode of trauma in male children, i.e. 59.47% (n = 477) followed by fall injuries, i.e. 29.42% (n = 236). In females, fall was the most common mode of trauma, i.e. 52.31% (n = 181) followed by RTA (36.70%, n = 127). Fall injuries occurred mostly at homes. Among RTA, hit by vehicle on road while playing was most common followed by passenger accidents on two wheelers, followed by hit by vehicle while walking to school. Among fall, fall while playing at home was the most common. Out of total 1148 patients, 304 (26.48%) comprised the polytrauma cases (involvement of more than two organ systems), followed by abdominal/pelvic trauma (20.99%, n = 241), followed by head/face trauma (19.86%, n = 228). Out of total 1148 patients admitted over a period of 36 months, 64 died (5.57%). 75 (6.5%) patients had some kind of residual deformity or disability. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The high incidence of pediatric trauma on roads and falls indicate the need for more supervision during playing and identification of specific risk factors for these injuries in our setting. This study shows that these epidemiological parameters could be a useful tool to identify burden and research priorities for specific type of injuries. A comprehensive trauma registry in our set up seems to be important for formulating policies to reduce pediatric trauma burden.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Unintentional (accidental) injuries in childhood constitute a significant public health problem. Young children are extremely vulnerable to unintentional injuries that are vastly preventable. All cases of fatal unintentional injuries in children aged 10 years and below autopsied during 1994-2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy five such cases were identified during the 14 year study period. Males accounted for 68% of cases with a male-female ratio of 2.1:1. Mean age of male and female victims was 5.3 and 4.9 years, respectively. Road traffic fatalities accounted for majority of the cases in this age group (52%), followed by those due to thermal injuries (22.7%). Flame was the cause of thermal injuries in 52.9% cases and scalds were observed in 47.1% cases. Traffic fatalities, fall and drowning were more common in school age children while toddlers and pre-school age children were relatively at a greater risk from domestic accidents (thermal injuries and poisoning). The most frequent victims of road traffic incidents were pedestrians (64.1%). Head injuries alone were the cause of fatalities in the majority of road traffic incidents (82.1%). The study highlights on the pattern of fatalities due to unintentional injuries among young children. To reduce the burden of unintentional childhood mortalities in this region, priorities for school age children are traffic injuries and for toddlers and pre-school children, thermal injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Data on types of community first aid use and treatment provided post-injury from many low‒middle-income countries, including India, are lacking. This cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged one month to 18 years of age, in Ujjain, India, to understand types of first aid given and health-seeking post-injury. A total of 1087 injuries in 1049 children were identified in the past year. A total of 729 (67%) injured children received first aid and 758 (70%) sought some form of health care. Children with burns received the most (86%) first aid, and most children (84%) with road traffic accidents (RTA) sought health care. Most children (52%) sought health care from a private health care facility; most children (65%) were transported to a health care facility within the golden hour. Motorbikes were the most preferred (50%) mode of transport. Only 1% of the injured used ambulance services. Commonly reported methods or substances for first aid included the use of coconut oil on wounds from falls (38%) and burns (44%), the use of antiseptic cream on wounds from RTA (31%), the application of turmeric for wounds from falls (16%), and rubbing of metal on a bitten area (47%). For most injuries, appropriate, locally available substances were used. Potentially harmful substances applied included lime, toothpaste, clay, and mud. The findings will help design community interventions to increase the provision of appropriate first aid for childhood injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Millions of children travel to school every day in India, yet little is known about this journey. We examined the distribution and determinants of school travel in Hyderabad, India. <br><br>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. School travel questionnaires were used to collect data from children aged 11-14 years, attending private, semi-private and government funded schools in Hyderabad. We used Google Earth to estimate the distance from home to school for each child and modelled the relationship between distance to school and mode of travel, adjusting for confounders. <br><br>RESULTS: Forty five of the 48 eligible schools that were selected agreed to participate, providing a total sample of 5842 children. The response rate was 99 %. Most children walked (57 %) or cycled (6 %) to school but 36 % used motorised transport (mostly bus). The proportion using motorised transport was higher in children attending private schools (41 %) than in those attending government schools (24 %). Most (90 %) children lived within 5km of school and 36 % lived within 1km. Greater distance to school was strongly associated with the use of motorised transport. Children living close to school were much more likely to walk or cycle. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Most children in Hyderabad walk (57 %) or cycle (6 %) to school. If these levels are to be maintained, there is an urgent need to ensure that walking and cycling are safe and pleasant. Social policies that decrease distances to school could have a large impact on road traffic injuries, air pollution, and physical activity levels.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Paediatric injuries are a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide and account for a significant burden on countries like India with limited resources. There are very few studies from developing nations describing the outcome of paediatric trauma.     Methodology: This retrospective study was done to assess the pattern and outcome of unintentional paediatric trauma in the paediatric population. The patients were categorised into four age groups of <1 year, 1-5 years, 6-10 years and 11-15 years. The data were compared regarding the mode of trauma, new injury severity score (NISS), type of injury and place of injury among different age groups.     Results: A total of 1587 paediatric patients below 15 years of age presenting in the Emergency Department of CMC, Vellore were studied over a period of 1 year. Two-thirds were boys (1039: 66.6%). Fall on level ground (28.2%) and road traffic accidents (RTA) (26.5%) were the two most common modes of injury. A gradual change in the place of incident from home to the road with advancing age was noticed. The upper limb (30.8%) and the face (26.2%) were the most common parts of the body to be injured. One-third (35.8%) of the sustained serious injuries was a fracture or a dislocation. RTA (OR: 1.56; 95%CI: 1.08-2.26) and age ≥5 years (OR: 1.17; 95%CI: 1.08-1.26) were found to be independent predictors of severe injury (NISS >8). Only 15% required hospital admission.     Conclusion: Fall on level ground and RTAs are the most common modes of injury in the paediatric population. The place of injury shows a gradual change from the confines of home to the open dangerous roads and playgrounds with increasing age with RTA and age ≥5 years being independent predictors of severe injury.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - To explore caregivers' perceptions of childhood injuries in the rural and urban areas of India, with a focus on causes, consequences, prevention, and treatment. We conducted eight focus group discussions with fifty female caregivers in rural and urban areas of Ujjain in Central India and used thematic content analysis. The caregivers identified how children injured themselves through falls, road traffic injuries, metallic nails and tool injuries, ingestions of foreign objects and poisons, burns, drowning, and suffocation. The reported consequences of injuries ranged from pain, infections, scar formation, phobia, stigma, and emotional stress to complications like physical disability, loss of eyesight, head injury, paralysis, and even death. Many caregivers blamed children and their mischievousness for the injuries and failed to realise/acknowledge the role of better supervision and environmental modifications in injury prevention. Caregivers used several first aid methods to respond to injuries. These included applying pressure to stop bleeding during fall and road traffic injuries, inducing vomiting by giving the poison victims saltwater to drink, and tobacco leaves to chew. In addition, some caregivers resorted to using coconut oil and toothpaste on burnt skin and giving back blows for choking. Caregivers in communities had experiences of different types of child injuries. Further education on need for better supervision, relevant environmental modification and appropriate first aid treatment of various injuries is required.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: India is motorising rapidly. With increasing motorisation, road traffic injuries are predicted to increase. A third of a billion children travel to school every day in India, but little is known about children's safety during the school commute. We investigated road traffic injury to children during school journeys. <br><br>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Hyderabad using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. We used school travel questionnaires to record any road injury in the past 12 months that resulted in at least 1 day of school missed or required treatment by a doctor or nurse. We estimated the prevalence of road injury by usual mode of travel and distance to school. <br><br>RESULTS: The total sample was 5842 children, of whom 5789 (99.1%) children answered the question on road injury. The overall prevalence of self-reported road injury in the last 12 months during school journeys was 17% (95% CI 12.9% to 21.7%). A higher proportion of boys (25%) reported a road injury than girls (11%). There was a strong association between road injury, travel mode and distance to school. Children who cycled to school were more likely to be injured compared with children who walked (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0). Travel by school bus was safer than walking (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.9). <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: A sixth of the children reported a road traffic injury in the past 12 months during school journeys in Hyderabad. Injury prevention interventions should focus on making walking and cycling safer for children.    Keywords: SR2S<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the road use pattern and incidence and risk factors of non-fatal road traffic injuries (RTI) among children aged 5–14 years in Hyderabad, India. METHODS: In a cross-sectional population-based survey, data were collected on 2809 participants aged 5–14 years (98.4% participation) selected using multi-stage cluster sampling. Participants recalled non-fatal RTI during the previous 3 and 12 months. RTI was defined as an injury resulting from a road traffic crash irrespective of severity and outcome. RESULTS: Boys (11.5) had a higher mean number of road trips per day than girls (9.6), and the latter were more likely to walk and less likely to use a cycle (p < 0.001). With increasing household income quartile,the proportion of trips using cycles or motorised two-wheeled vehicles increased while trips as pedestrians decreased (p < 0.001). Based on the 3-month recall period, the age-sex-adjusted annual rate of RTI requiring recovery period of >7 days was 5.8% (95% CI 4.9–6.6). Boys and girls had similar RTI rates as pedestrians but boys had a three times higher rate as cyclists. Considering the most recent RTI in the last 12 months, children of the highest household income quartile were significantly less likely to sustain pedestrian RTI (0.26, 95% CI 0.08–0.86). The odds of overall RTI were significantly higher for those who rode a cycle (2.45, 95% CI 1.75–3.42) and who currently drove a motorised two-wheeled vehicle (2.83,95% CI 1.60–5.00). CONCLUSION: These findings can assist in planning appropriate road safety initiatives to reduce cycle and pedestrian RTI among children to reduce RTI burden in India.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Though, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been documented as the single most common cause of morbidity and mortality in infancy and childhood, the exact incidence is unavailable in India. Moreover, modes of injury, mechanisms of damage, and management differ significantly from that of an adult.     Aims and Objectives: To analyze the epidemiological factors, the spectrum of TBI, modes of injury, types of injury, and the outcome in the children <15 years with TBI. Materials and     Methods: This is a retrospective study from August 2012 to May 2013 at Department of Neurosurgery, S.C.B. Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha, India. All the pertinent details from case records of hundred and forty-seven children <15 years with TBI were analyzed. Follow-up was done for 6 months at outpatients department.     Results: Age wise, incidence and severity of TBI is more common in 10-15 years. Males outnumber females with a male: female ratio 2.19:1. Overall, road traffic accident (RTA) is the commonest mode of injury. Assault is not uncommon (7.48% cases). Falls is common in <5 years while RTA is common in 5-15 years. The extradural hematoma was the most common injury pattern; however, surgical consideration was maximal for fracture skull. Overall mortality was 7.48%. Diffuse axonal injury has the maximum individual potential for mortality. We noticed excellent recovery in 68.7%, disabilities in 17.68%, and persistent vegetative state in 5.45% cases.     Conclusion: TBI in children carries good outcome, if resuscitated and referred early to a neurotrauma center, and managed subsequently on an individualized basis with a well-organized team approach. Severe TBI in children has a poor outcome.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Children are regarded as the most liable road users as pedestrians because of their specific traffic behaviours, which demand close investigation. The present study conducts a comprehensive systematic review aiming to draw attention to the need for a thorough understanding of child pedestrian safety, especially in the Indian context, and to provide insights that can guide the implementation of evidence-based initiatives to safeguard children on roads. Using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, the study searched Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar and Scopus for relevant literature. Finally, 78 research papers and 8 reports were examined and reviewed. The review analysed the literature on the basis of study locations, methods of data collection, parameters affecting child pedestrian behaviour and safety, and existing techniques and models for analysing child pedestrian behaviour and safety. Additionally, worldwide strategies adopted to improve child pedestrian safety were reviewed. The findings across the literature revealed a significant contribution of studies from China, with limited representation from India. Numerous studies have employed questionnaire surveys as a means of data collection and regression analysis to model the behaviour and safety of child pedestrians. The findings of the study sheds light onto the parameters influencing child pedestrian behaviour and safety, with special emphasis on socio-demographic characteristics, peer influence, adult supervision, distractions, disabilities, socio-economic factors, and human factors. The study establishes a foundation for targeted interventions that can reduce pedestrian risks and create a safe environment so that children can navigate independently. The study also discusses limitations and the scope for further research on child pedestrians' behaviour and safety on streets, especially in Indian context.<p />

N2  - PURPOSE: Diaphragmatic injuries have been reported to be a predictor of serious associated injuries in trauma and a marker of severity. Because of its rarity in children, the diagnosis is often delayed for months and years, due to overshadowing injuries. Perhaps due to the elasticity of their tissues, traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is uncommon in children. The problem remains a challenging clinical entity and the description of such type of injuries in children remains scarce in the literature. Most of the cases are described along with associated injuries; presence of isolated diaphragmatic injuries in children is unusual. The present study highlights the presentation, diagnosis and management of all of the cases admitted with traumatic diaphragmatic injuries in a single pediatric surgical center. METHODS: We retrospectively studied eight children admitted to our center with a diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury following trauma during a period of 5 years (2003-2008). Relevant information regarding the mode and pattern of injuries were noted in all cases. Type of injury and surgical intervention and outcome of patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of presentation was 6.8 years (range 2-12 years). Seven patients were males, while one patient was female. Seven patients had a history of blunt trauma abdomen some time back. Only one patient had acute presentation with respiratory distress following road traffic accident, rest of the patients had no associated grievous injury at the time of presentation. One patient presented with features of acute obstruction. All patients could be diagnosed preoperatively and surgical intervention was performed in all cases. The patients recovered well and there was no mortality. CONCLUSION: Diaphragmatic injuries in children are rare. They are usually associated with other severe injuries; however, isolated diaphragmatic injuries occur more frequently in children than adults. A high index of clinical suspicion supported by prompt radiological tests is needed to diagnose these injuries in patients who otherwise have no associated grievous injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Childhood injuries claim around a million lives around the world each year. A community-based study on childhood injuries would provide valuable information on the epidemiology of injuries. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of unintentional childhood injuries in an urban locality and determine various sociodemo graphic factors associated with childhood injuries. <br><br>METHODS: The study was done in urban Delhi among 1,639 children aged less than 18 years. Information on injuries in the last one year was collected. Only those injury episodes where treatment was sought or the child was left disabled after the injury were included. Treatment seeking behavior and the impact of injury on the child and the household were also assessed. <br><br>RESULTS: Among 1,639 children, 102 children suffered 116 episodes of various types of injuries in the last one year. Prevalence of injuries was 7.1% (95% CI: 5.9-8.4). Mean age was 8.5 ± 5.1 years. Prevalence was more in boys (8.4%) than girls (5.1%). Accidental falls (37.1%), dog bites (25%), and road traffic injuries (18.9%) were the three most common modes of injury. Two-thirds of children with injuries were taken to the emergency facility for treatment while 40% resorted to home remedies. Treatment expenses in some families led to the need for borrowing money, additional employment by another family member, and selling of household assets. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood injuries in the past one year was 7.1%. Maximum injuries occurred at home and were mostly accidental falls and dog bites. Childhood injuries caused loss of school attendance and financial burden to the family.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - World Health Organization global disease update (2004) points out injuries as the sixth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. A descriptive hospital based study was conducted to find out the common types of unintentional injuries among children admitted for management of unintentional injuries in Pediatric Surgery department and Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care hospital of North Kerala and to find out the contributing risk factors. A total of 400 children admitted during the study period of 6 months of 2009 constituted the study population. Mechanical injuries comprising of Road traffic accidents and accidental fall were the major cause of unintentional injuries (36%), followed by Poisoning (22.3%). A higher proportion of unintentional injuries were noted to occur among children of younger mothers, overactive child, children belonging to extended or joint families, child left alone or with friends, pre-school children, male child and from urban dwellings. The study highlights the need to identify the different types of unintentional injuries and the risk factors of childhood injuries which require hospitalisation. Identification of risk factors will help to formulate strategies aimed at risk reduction and prevention of childhood injuries.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - On any given day, almost 3400 people die globally due to road traffic accidents. The global status report from WHO in 2013 estimates that in India alone approximately 231,000 people are killed due to RTAs yearly. The majority of the victims are unfortunately children, elderly and innocent pedestrians. Due to these astonishing numbers, in 2014 the UN General Assembly, in union with a dozen countries, adopted a resolution of "Improving global road safety". The aim of this study is to assess the basic road safety knowledge and practices among the youth in a medical college in Kancheepuram district in Tamil Nadu. The data was collected through a cross sectional study using a semi structured questionnaire which was distributed to around 300 medical students. The data collected was then analyzed using standard statistical tests through SPSS. Of the 300 students, around 170 (56.6%) were female and 130 (43.3%) were males. All students were in the age range of 20-25 years. Overall safety awareness was more among the male population (76%) as compared to the female (70%). Majority (73%) of the participants also had a decent knowledge of safe road practices such as maintaining speed limits, wearing seat belts, waiting in zebra crossings, observing traffic signals and road signs. Majority (72%) also knew that talking, listening to loud music can be distracting during driving and driving under the influence can be fatal. However, approximately 40% of these same students admitted that they don't put their knowledge to use and frequently fail to practice proper road safety. Thus, this study illustrates the need not only to provide education about road safety but to provide training and instigate stronger roles of local governments to implement these safer road practices. Only then can we effectively reduce the occurrence and morbidity of RTAs. <p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions in healthcare systems worldwide, with Varanasi, India, experiencing profound challenges in managing mortality rates. In order to inform public health initiatives, it is important to comprehend how the pandemic has affected all-cause unnatural death in comparison to pre-pandemic patterns. This retrospective study intended to investigate patterns of all-cause unnatural mortality employing autopsy records of cases from Varanasi's Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University during the pre-pandemic and pandemic period (First and Second wave) of COVID-19. The analysis included 2694 cases of unnatural mortality, such as road traffic accident (RTA), poisoning, hanging and other causes. Demographic, clinical, and circumstantial data were collected and compared between the two time periods, that revealed significant as well as non-significant shifts in all-cause unnatural mortality rates. Whilst certain types of unnatural deaths, such as RTAs, witnessed a non-significant 2.03% (p = 0.34722) decrease, others like hanging exhibited an unexpected significant 3.17% (p = 0.01732) rise, burning and poisoning witnessed a significant 4.18% (p = 0.00026) and 2.37% (p = 0.0271) decline respectively. RTA was the leading cause of mortality both during and before pandemic. Male deaths (79.18%) outweighed female deaths (20.82%) by a more substantial amount throughout research periods. Additionally, variations in demographic characteristics, circumstances surrounding deaths, and healthcare utilization were observed during the pandemic period. The majority of unnatural fatalities occur in the age group of 21-30 years old in both pre-pandemic (22.62%) and pandemic conditions (26.65%). This study provides important insights into the secondary effects of the pandemic on unnatural mortality and emphasizes the need for individualized public health. Furthermore, research is warranted to explore the long-term implications and address the associated challenges for healthcare systems and public health initiatives.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: More than 1.2 million deaths occur each year on the world's roads. In India, the number of motor vehicles on the road is increasing with the population and economic growth. It has been estimated that if effective and immediate action is not taken, deaths due to road traffic accidents will become the fifth leading cause of deaths by 2020. <br><br>OBJECTIVEs was to assess the level of awareness and behavior regarding road safety rules among undergraduate medical students.     Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted in a Medical College of western Uttar Pradesh. In the present study 200 final and pre-final year, undergraduate medical students were selected with the help of simple random selection, who drive/use vehicles either of their own or others. The study period was from June 2019 to August 2019.     Results: About 29 percent of participants responded that they do not follow lane rules while driving. Study showed that 72.1% and 42.0% were aware that what documents to be carried with them while driving among those who attend and did not attend any program on road safety measures respectively. About 58.1 % and 38.2% were aware that penalty for driving without a helmet can be imposed among those who attend and did not attend any program on road safety measures.     Conclusions: Awareness of road safety measures among participants was satisfactory, but the gap was also seen between awareness and behavior patterns regarding road safety measures.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries are a major but neglected epidemic. WHO has declared road traffic accidents (RTA) as the number one cause of death among those aged 15-29 years. India has witnessed 31.3% of the road traffic deaths among 15 to 29 years individuals in the year 2011 as reported by national crime records bureau. This study is aimed to learn and study risk perception and practice of road safety measures among medical students.<br><br>METHODS: A Cross-sectional study was conducted among medical students with an objective A 297 M.B.B.S. students were selected by convenient sampling technique. The study period was May-August, 2016. The information collected was analysed using SPSS version 16 & Microsoft excels 2007 software.<br><br>RESULTS: Majority of boys (82% and 98%) and girls (55% & 66%) had a satisfactory understanding of traffic rules and traffic signs & signals, respectively. While exploring on the helmet use, only 36% of girls were aware of its importance. About the factors responsible for the crash severity, participants showed a lesser concern to the seat-belts & child restraints (59% boys and 39% girls). Notably only 52% of male participants were in view that alcohol consumption sometimes increases the severity while driving.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Abidance to road safety was not found satisfactory. Adequate interventions and reorientation training towards road safety need to be introduced among young drivers.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Traffic injuries are one of the major causes of morbidity in India. It involves human sufferings in terms of physical, emotional, and financial losses to the individual, family, and the country. A better insight into the epidemiological determinants will help prevent such injuries. <br><br>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the proportion of fatal and nonfatal accidents and to determine the epidemiological factors related to nonfatal accidents. <br><br>METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study carried out in a tertiary care hospital over a period of 6 months. A simple random sampling technique was used for the selection of sample size of 476. Nonfatal accident victims were interviewed. <br><br>RESULTS: The proportion of nonfatal to fatal accidents was found to be 1.8:1. Around 72.9% of drivers did not use any safety measure while driving. Two-wheelers (39%) and light motor vehicles (28.3%) were mostly involved, 45% of drivers had speed more than 60 km/h. Obstacles in the road (41%), defective roads (36.5%), and poor street lighting (11.4%) were reported as contributing factors of the accident. Lower extremities and head neck and face were involved in 47.2% and 27.1% of cases, respectively. Around 40.4% of cases had a single-site fracture. <br><br>CONCLUSION: Traffic injuries result from the interaction between agent, host, and environmental factors. Preventing these interactions is very well possible with little extra care given towards road safety and traffic behavior of individuals.<br><br>Copyright: © 2020 Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The annual mortality of road traffic injuries (RTIs) is estimated to be over 80,000 in India; however, there is not enough information about the magnitude, pattern, and factors associated with RTIs in a population-based scenario, where the police and hospital records suffer from severe underreporting. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying the burden, pattern, and risk factors of RTIs in the population of Pune City.     METHOD: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 9014 individuals in a randomly selected and representative sample of the population from 14 administrative wards of the city from March 2008 to April 2009.     RESULTS: The annual incidence rate of RTIs was 93.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.2-103.2) per 1000 individuals and after adjustment for age it was 76.4 per 1000 individuals. Injury occurrence was significantly more among the age group 15-30, males, and students and workers. Univariate analysis showed a significant association between RTIs and age, gender, occupation, mode of transport, driving a vehicle, and alcohol abuse. Multivariate analysis showed that only age, driving a vehicle, and alcohol abuse were the factors associated with RTIs.     CONCLUSION: The magnitude of RTIs in India is very high, which is not reflected in police registration reports.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: While road traffic accidents are declining in many developed countries, fatalities are still on the rise in many developing countries including India. More than half of the road traffic injury (RTI) victims are in the age group of 20-55 years, which constitutes the key wage-earning and child-raising age group. <br><br>OBJECTIVE: To study the socio-demographic profile of RTI victims and to study the pattern of injury among them. <br><br>METHODS AND MATERIAL: The RTI victims brought to the casualty of Goa Medical College and Hospital were interviewed using a predesigned questionnaire following transfer to in-patient wards after initial stabilisation in the casualty. Data are expressed as proportions and presented using graphs and charts. <br><br>RESULTS: A majority of the RTI victims, i.e., 134 (30.45%) were in the age group of 30-40 years. The findings reveal that 33 (13.04%) RTI victims did not have a valid driving licence, while the use of alcohol within 6 h before accident was seen in 38 (12.75%) RTI victims; 234 (65.36%) victims were not using a seat belt or helmet and 350 (79.55%) victims had grievous injuries. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: A high number of drivers were driving without a valid driving licence while a good number of RTI victims consumed alcohol putting themselves as well as other commuters at risk. There is a need for increasing awareness among the road users and community regarding road safety. Government authorities should ensure consistent and strict implementation of traffic rules as well as accelerate the implementation of road-safety preventive measures.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Statistics show an increasing proportion of alcohol and drug use in drivers in more recent times throughout the world. It has been found that among the various human factors, alcohol consumption, using drugs and subsequent driving on the roads are major risk factors. Traffic regulations in India penalises drivers who drive beyond permissible alcohol limit of 30 mg%. Consumption of psychoactive drugs such as opioid, cannabis and benzodiazepines has been reported mainly among youngsters. Hardly any data is available in Indian context particularly from North-West Zone of India. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of alcohol, opioid, cannabis and benzodiazepines use in injured drivers presenting to a designated trauma centre in Chandigarh zone of North-West India. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consenting injured drivers who presented to the trauma centre in Chandigarh from September 2013 to January 2014 were included. Urine samples collected from the subjects were screened for abusive drug exposure (opioid, cannabis and benzodiazepines) and alcohol using commercial bedside urine immunoassay kits. In urine alcohol positive cases blood samples were collected and analysed for alcohol concentration using standard gas chromatography. Retrograde extrapolation method was used to assess BAC at the time of accident. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 200 injured drivers were included in this study. We found substance consumption in 54.5% of drivers and alcohol (40.5%) was the most prevalent substance consumed followed by opiates (13%), cannabis (7%) and benzodiazepines (7%). More than one substance was shown in urine of 11.5% of drivers. Among 81 alcohol positive screening cases, the quantitative analysis was successfully done for 76 cases. Except one, all cases showed BAC value more than 30 mg% which is the legal limit for driving any vehicle in India. The values of alcohol concentration in blood at the time of accident were in the range of 20 to 391 mg%. <br><br>CONCLUSION: This study has shown that drivers are consuming not only alcohol but other psychoactive drugs also. Indian traffic regulatory authorities are penalising drunk drivers by doing road side breath alcohol testing with no protocols for drug screening. Appropriate measures should be adopted to screen traffic offenders for psychoactive drugs also.    Keywords: Cannabis impaired driving; DUID; Ethanol impaired driving  <p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Objective: India reported the highest number of road traffic crashes, related injuries, and deaths among all countries in the world, with 105,725 road traffic fatalities and 452,922 nonfatal road traffic injuries in 2007. In this report we present a systematic review of available literature on the use of psychoactive substances (alcohol and drugs) among road users, particularly those involved in road traffic crashes (RTCs). Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ind Medica, and several other databases were searched for reports published between 1980 and 2011 that present data on the prevalence or extent of substance use among road users in India. Results: Among the 23 studies eligible for the review, alcohol was reported by all, but only 2 mentioned the use of drugs. Most of the studies were hospital based, included injured or killed road users, and belonged to southern parts of India. Seven studies did not report any method for detecting alcohol use, whereas 7 used analytical testing, 7 used self-reporting, and 2 used observation. Utilizing the various means of verification, the studies reported that 2 to 33 percent of injured and 6 to 48 percent of killed RTC victims had consumed alcohol or drugs; only 2 mentioned drugs without specifying which types. Most studies did not distinguish between drivers, passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians, and none investigated alcohol or drug use among those responsible for the accident. Conclusion: A significant proportion of injured or killed road users in India had used alcohol before the accident. However, the existing studies cannot be used to estimate the risk of accident involvement among drunk drivers. There is a need for more rigorous research and capacity building on substance use vis-à-vis road traffic crashes.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance globally (Preuss et al., 2021). Several nations decriminalized and/or legalized cannabis use for medical and recreational purposes in the past two decades. The change that started with California in 1996, grew to 37 states in the US along with 4 territories and the District of Columbia (The State of U.S. Cannabis Legalization in 2022, 2022). South- Asian countries, initially reluctant to accept these changes of policy, also took a few steps in this direction in the last 3-4 years. Thailand, South Korea and Japan legalized medical marijuana in 2019, while India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan and other countries continue to maintain their punitive stance against cannabis use (Root, 2022).     Legal or not, the association between cannabis and road traffic accidents cannot and should not be ignored. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews indicated significantly increased odds (OR ranging from 1.31 to 3.63) of road traffic accidents while driving after cannabis use (Aydelotte et al., 2021, Martin et al., 2017). There is also an indication of a dose-dependent delay in responsiveness among drivers under the influence of cannabis (Li et al., 2012). After alcohol, Tetra-hydro cannabinol (THC) is the most frequently found psychoactive substance in the blood of drivers involved in road traffic accidents (Hostiuc et al., 2018). In the past decade, rates of driving under the influence of cannabis have increased. The 2012 DRUID (Driving Under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol and Medicines) Project under EMCDDA (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs Drug Addiction), included 50,000 drivers from 13 countries and reported cannabis use while driving in 1.32% drivers, out of whom 27% were involved in car crashes and up to 7.6% of them were severely injured. More recent data from the US reported prevalence of "cannabis positive driving" as high as 11.1% (Martin et al., 2017). Research has also indicated a noticeable increase in road traffic accidents in the nations that legalized recreational cannabis. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety's report in 2020 from Washington stated that prior to the legalization of marijuana in the state, about 8.8% of drivers involved in fatal traffic crashes tested positive for THC. This figure doubled to 18% in the next 2 years and within 5 years of legalization, 21.7% of drivers involved in fatal accidents were THC-positive (Aydelotte et al., 2017, Watkins, 2021). Similar observations have been reported from the states of California, Colorado, Nevada and Oregon among others (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and Highway Loss Data Institute, 2021).     Studies estimate more than 24 million cannabis users in South East Asia region, out of which up to 1.6% belong to the age group of 15-64 years, a population group most likely to be driving or engaged in associated activities...

N2  - Maxillofacial injuries are unique because of the anatomical complexity of the area and their associated psychological effects. An understanding of the epidemiology of these injuries is important if we are to develop preventive measures, increase the efficiency and delivery of health services, improve the skills of healthcare providers, and better distribute resources. We retrospectively evaluated data on 4455 patients (aged between 3 and 84 years) who presented with maxillofacial injuries to a tertiary referral hospital in Ahmedabad, India, between 1 January 1999 and 31 January 2010. Of these, 18 needed only rest and medication so 4437 were included. Data included patients'characteristics and the cause of injury. Details on the presentation and severity of injury, associated injuries including head injuries, the influence of alcohol and other drugs, treatment, and outcome, were also included. Around one-third were aged between 21and 30 years, and the male to female ratio was 5:1. The main causes of injury were road traffic accidents (n=2347, 53%) and interpersonal violence (n=1041, 23%). Most road traffic accidents involved two-wheeled vehicles. Alcohol was associated with 11% of injuries. A total of 2546 patients (57%) had mandibular fractures. To reduce the number of injuries we need better road safety laws with stringent enforcement, and the public, particularly those between 15 and 45 years of age, must be educated about road safety.<p/>  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Each year in India, road traffic crashes lead to more than 200,000 deaths and the country has seen an unprecedented rate of roadway fatalities in recent years. At the same time, alcohol consumption per capita among Indians is rising. Despite these increasing trends of road traffic injuries (RTIs) and alcohol use, alcohol is not routinely assessed as a risk factor for RTIs. This study aims to examine the involvement of alcohol among emergency department patients presenting with RTIs in the Indian city of Hyderabad. <br><br>PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of a prospective study, data were collected from 3366 patients (88.0% male) presenting with RTIs at an emergency department in Hyderabad, India, from September 2013 to February 2014. Logistic regression models were used to assess individual-level and road traffic crash characteristics associated with suspected or reported alcohol consumption six hours prior to the RTI. <br><br>RESULTS: Alcohol was suspected or reported among 17.9% of the patients with RTIs. Adjusting for confounders, males experienced 9.8 times greater odds of alcohol-related RTIs than females. Compared to 15-24 year-olds, the odds of alcohol consumption was 1.4 times greater among 25-34 year-olds and 1.7 times greater among 35-44 year-olds, adjusting for confounding factors. Patients who were passengers in vehicles other than motorized two-wheelers had 90% reduced odds of an alcohol-related RTI than motorized two-wheeler drivers. Drivers of non-two-wheelers, passengers on two-wheelers, and pedestrians did not have significantly different odds of an alcohol-related RTI compared to two-wheeler drivers. Nighttime crashes were associated with nearly a threefold increase in the odds of alcohol consumption. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS: Given that alcohol was suspected or reported in more than one in six injured ED patients with RTIs, it is clear that alcohol is a serious risk factor for RTIs; this evidence can guide prevention efforts. These findings suggest that evidence-based interventions to reduce drink-driving, such as random breath testing (where law enforcement officials stop drivers on the road to test them for alcohol use), could be more widespread in India. Future studies should assess the effectiveness of greater implementation and enforcement of policies to decrease alcohol's availability to reduce RTIs.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is common in many cultures. Excessive use of alcohol adversely impacts individuals, families and communities. Medicine, which uses biomedical models and perspectives, views alcohol dependence as a disease. Alcohol use and dependence are complex societal problems, which need to be viewed through multidisciplinary approaches and corrected by adopting intersectoral efforts involving local communities. <br><br>METHODS: We used qualitative methods such as focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to document perspectives on alcohol use among a tribal community in southern India. We recorded traditional norms, changing patterns of use of alcohol and its consequences for individuals, families and the community. <br><br>RESULTS: Eight focus group discussions and eleven in-depth interviews were conducted. Though consumption of alcohol is part of the local culture, changes in occupation and availability of alcohol has made its consumption a problem. The introduction and easy availability of Indian-made foreign liquor, which is stronger than the locally brewed variety, in government-run outlets has changed the culture of drinking at festivals to drinking more often. This leads to public fights, domestic violence and increasing mortality and morbidity due to road traffic incidents and ill health. The age of initiation into drinking has decreased. <br><br>CONCLUSION: The introduction of non-traditional and commercial alcohol use has put a heavy price on tribal and rural people. Community-based interventions targeting young children and adolescents may pay more dividends than pursuing purely medical treatments for problem drinkers.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - Road traffic accidents are a major cause of fatalities around the world, and a number of deaths are caused by moving traffic on public roads. Deaths from vehicles that are off the highway may be called non-traffic fatalities which can be due to a vehicle reversing, carbon monoxide poisoning, weather-induced over-heating inside the vehicle and electric windows. Children (and animals) are the usual victims. We report a case from India where a man was found lying dead by the roadside with a lorry nearby. The autopsy findings indicated that he had been run over, but as there was no history of a vehicular collision and with no eyewitnesses, the investigators were unsure of the probable sequence of events that led to his death. The autopsy findings, history, circumstantial evidence and chemical analysis enabled us to work out what had happened.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road traffic accidents (RTAs) represents a major epidemic of non-communicable disease in the present century affecting families, community and nation as a whole. <br><br>OBJECTIVES were to study the epidemiological determinants of RTAs.     Methods: A hospital based study of RTA victims was conducted for a period of one year at the District General Hospital and Medical College hospital of Amravati, Maharashtra. A total of 1394 patients were studied. Descriptive statistics like percentage and proportions were calculated. Proportions were compared using Chi square test of significance.     Results: 86.7% were males and the maximum affected age group was 21 to 30 years. Majority of accidents were seen in summer season and on Monday of the week. Accidents were highest from 12 noon to 6 pm. Alcohol consumption was seen in 27% of the drivers. Two-wheelers were the commonest vehicle involved in RTAs. A total of 481 (34.5%) victims had fractures at various sites of the body, out of this 52.8% was of lower limbs. Right sided bony injuries were more common.     Conclusions: There are multiple factors associated with RTAs which due to the lack of road safety measures in the country are playing their role. It is the need of the hour to address this issue and formulate rules and regulations and evaluate its enforcement.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - The objective of the study was to assess the epidemiological factors of road traffic accident victims, which will give a clue on the risk factor in road traffic accidents. As per the report from Transport Research Wing, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India approximately 400 people die per day because of road traffic accidents, in 1 hour 57 accidents occur in which 17 victims die of which 54% victims are between 15 to 34 years19. The study involves 100 victims of Road Traffic Accidents reported to Government Sivagangai Medical College and Hospitals. About 64% victims are in productive age group. About 64% victims are due to accidents caused by driver under alcoholism, of which >60% suffer from greivious injury. 40% of road traffic accidents are due to over speeding. Hence, Alcohol places an important role in occurring of road traffic accidents and in determining the nature of accident and injuries. Proper education and alcohol abstinence can reduce the RTA and prevent excess load on health care system and reduce the economic loss of the family and the country as whole.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>

N2  - BACKGROUND: Roadside trauma in India is an increasingly significant problem, particularly because of bad roads, irregular road signs, overcrowding, overspeeding, and bad traffic etiquettes. Adequate information on the characteristics of victims, causes of accidents, frequency, vehicles involved, alcohol intake, and outcome of management is essential for understanding and planning for better management. <br><br>AIM: This study aimed to determine the characteristics of trauma (roadside accidents) victims admitted to various trauma centers in India. The purpose of this study is to examine the epidemiology of trauma within a local community in India through data gained from the different emergency centers and to analyze trauma patients to find the predictors that led to the deaths of trauma patients. <br><br>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present observational study involved trauma victims over 1-year period in three centers. Demographical details recorded were age, sex, alcohol intake, systolic blood pressure on arrival, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, the interval between injury and admission, Injury Severity Score (ISS) risk factors, hospital stay, and outcome. <br><br>RESULTS: A total of 2650 injuries were recorded in 2466 patients. The mean age was 42.45 ± 15.7 years, the mean ISS was 13.82 ± 6.2, and the mean GCS was 12.20 ± 4.1. The mean time to admission at different trauma centres was 48.41 ± 172.8 h. The head injury was the most common (29.52%). <br><br>CONCLUSION: Road side accidents due to overspeeding was the most common cause whereas driving under the effect of alcohol was the second most common cause. Accidents are common because of bad traffic etiquette on Indian roads.<br><br>Copyright: © 2020 International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science.<p />  <p>Language: en</p>
